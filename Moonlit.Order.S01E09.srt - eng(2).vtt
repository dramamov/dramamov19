my brilliant mind

00:04:24.933 --> 00:04:26.493
to devise an escape plan?

00:04:27.733 --> 00:04:28.693
You were faking sleep.

00:04:31.053 --> 00:04:31.813
No, I wasn't.

00:05:17.608 --> 00:05:18.253
That's right.

00:05:19.373 --> 00:05:20.092
The water

00:05:20.733 --> 00:05:22.173
receded last night.

00:05:23.013 --> 00:05:24.493
But now it's flooded back.

00:05:24.813 --> 00:05:25.813
This means it connects

00:05:26.693 --> 00:05:27.652

00:13:59.812 --> 00:14:01.013

00:14:07.973 --> 00:14:08.932
come and save you?

00:14:11.172 --> 00:14:12.532
Because he's already dead.

00:14:18.093 --> 00:14:19.532

00:14:39.892 --> 00:14:40.572

00:15:13.532 --> 00:15:14.213
She's cheap.

00:15:14.333 --> 00:15:15.052
Four wen.

00:15:17.013 --> 00:15:18.093
Thank you, my lords.

00:16:01.772 --> 00:16:03.453
Come on. I'll take you to swing.

00:16:08.532 --> 00:16:09.292
Are you ready?

00:16:10.133 --> 00:16:10.652
Here we go.

00:16:33.853 --> 00:16:34.412
A kite.

00:16:46.052 --> 00:16:47.133
A kite must fly

00:16:47.733 --> 00:16:48.772
against the wind.

00:16:50.253 --> 00:16:51.572
And no matter how high it flies,

00:16:52.072 --> 00:16:53.133
I hold the string.

00:16:54.453 --> 00:16:55.172
Unfortunately,

00:16:55.692 --> 00:16:56.572
I can't go outside.

00:16:57.213 --> 00:16:58.733
Why can't you go out?

00:17:00.812 --> 00:17:01.493
Because

00:17:02.692 --> 00:17:03.532
this is home.

00:17:04.253 --> 00:17:05.653
The guards and my mother told me

00:17:06.173 --> 00:17:07.372
that only home is safe.

00:17:32.200 --> 00:17:35.048
(Feng)

00:17:37.733 --> 00:17:38.332
Young Master.

00:17:38.453 --> 00:17:40.092
Is my embroidery beautiful?

00:17:40.493 --> 00:17:41.092
Yes, it is.

00:18:00.733 --> 00:18:01.493
Young Master.

00:18:01.893 --> 00:18:04.413
Didn't you say it's safe at home?

00:18:04.552 --> 00:18:06.612
Why are bandits coming to kill us?

00:18:07.292 --> 00:18:08.213
We've been betrayed.

00:18:09.013 --> 00:18:09.532
Feng.

00:18:10.173 --> 00:18:11.612
We can't trust anyone anymore.

00:18:12.173 --> 00:18:13.973
Young master, I'm scared.

00:18:16.933 --> 00:18:18.052
Bite my arm.

00:18:33.893 --> 00:18:35.453
(Stay alive.)

00:19:03.092 --> 00:19:04.013
Young master.

00:19:05.733 --> 00:19:06.933
Young master.

00:19:08.132 --> 00:19:09.572
Young master.

00:19:22.440 --> 00:19:26.728
(Tomb of Young Master)

00:19:29.213 --> 00:19:30.653
The dead can't return to life.

00:19:33.092 --> 00:19:33.893
Do you know

00:19:34.132 --> 00:19:35.772
why you lost him?

00:19:39.332 --> 00:19:39.933
It's because

00:19:40.413 --> 00:19:41.612
you weren't strong enough.

00:19:42.612 --> 00:19:44.812
You must become the strongest

00:19:46.772 --> 00:19:48.173
to avoid

00:19:49.292 --> 00:19:50.852
being hurt.

00:19:55.893 --> 00:19:57.332
Water only after training.

00:19:58.332 --> 00:19:58.933
The weak

00:19:59.772 --> 00:20:01.253
don't deserve to live.

00:21:17.253 --> 00:21:18.292
Thank you.

00:21:19.013 --> 00:21:19.772
Hang in there.

00:21:31.812 --> 00:21:32.612
This circle

00:21:33.372 --> 00:21:34.893
is your arena.

00:21:36.052 --> 00:21:37.052
Anyone who steps out

00:21:37.933 --> 00:21:38.693
dies immediately.

00:21:39.812 --> 00:21:40.612
Among you,

00:21:40.933 --> 00:21:42.372
only the strongest one

00:21:43.092 --> 00:21:43.933
will survive

00:21:44.772 --> 00:21:46.372
and be my successor as the commander

00:21:47.292 --> 00:21:48.812
of the Xue Guardians.

00:21:51.132 --> 00:21:52.572
You'll no longer get beaten

00:21:52.933 --> 00:21:53.772
like stray dogs,

00:21:54.213 --> 00:21:55.572
beggars, or livestock.

00:21:56.893 --> 00:21:57.772
You'll become

00:21:58.532 --> 00:21:59.816
His Majesty's confidants.

00:22:31.733 --> 00:22:32.292
Careful.

00:22:50.132 --> 00:22:52.052
The two of you will fight to the death.

00:22:53.013 --> 00:22:53.893
The winner

00:22:54.132 --> 00:22:55.693
becomes the next commander.

00:23:26.372 --> 00:23:27.653
The former commander is dead.

00:23:28.413 --> 00:23:29.372
I am the new commander.

00:23:30.733 --> 00:23:31.413
Heed my order.

00:23:32.413 --> 00:23:33.572
End the internal battles.

00:23:34.132 --> 00:23:34.973
Right now.

00:23:35.532 --> 00:23:36.292
Violators will be

00:23:37.013 --> 00:23:37.493
executed.

00:24:01.532 --> 00:24:03.612
Thank you for clearing
all obstacles for me.

00:24:04.173 --> 00:24:05.532
You should've died long ago.

00:24:32.493 --> 00:24:33.332
Though His Majesty

00:24:33.332 --> 00:24:34.693
rescued and cultivated me,

00:24:35.213 --> 00:24:35.852
still,

00:24:37.213 --> 00:24:40.013
I was betrayed by my sworn comrades.

00:24:41.092 --> 00:24:42.772
Thus, I'll trust no one ever again.

00:24:43.812 --> 00:24:44.973
I must grow strong

00:24:45.572 --> 00:24:47.132
to avoid any harm.

00:24:49.372 --> 00:24:50.532
It's a shame I can't repay

00:24:52.612 --> 00:24:53.973
Young Master's kindness.

00:24:58.213 --> 00:24:58.933
He was kind.

00:24:59.893 --> 00:25:01.413
But are you sure His Majesty...

00:25:05.332 --> 00:25:06.893
Meant to cultivate you?

00:25:07.213 --> 00:25:08.812
If he truly cared about you,

00:25:09.372 --> 00:25:10.612
would he have let you

00:25:10.852 --> 00:25:11.653
become ruthless

00:25:12.253 --> 00:25:13.173
and devoid of emotion?

00:25:15.372 --> 00:25:16.693
Without His Majesty,

00:25:17.653 --> 00:25:18.772
I would have died.
