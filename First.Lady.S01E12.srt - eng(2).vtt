00:00:56.369 --> 00:00:57.787
You're with Hwa-jin, right?

00:00:57.871 --> 00:00:59.414
Bring her over right now.

00:00:59.497 --> 00:01:00.373
I'll take her

00:01:00.456 --> 00:01:03.209
to President-elect
and have it out with him.

00:01:03.293 --> 00:01:06.713
But Lee Hwa-jin is
with President-elect's daughter now.

00:01:06.796 --> 00:01:07.755
What?

00:01:08.381 --> 00:01:09.215
Are you sure?

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:10.925
Yes, I'm sure.

00:01:22.812 --> 00:01:24.022
Let me

00:01:25.523 --> 00:01:26.858
meet that person.

00:01:27.567 --> 00:01:28.401
Who?

00:01:29.444 --> 00:01:30.528
Lee Hwa-jin.

00:01:44.542 --> 00:01:46.711
I read it because you asked me to.

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:48.671
But why?

00:01:48.755 --> 00:01:52.133
I thought you might be curious
about why my mom did that.

00:01:54.677 --> 00:01:57.347
I would've been curious
if I were in your shoes.

00:01:57.972 --> 00:02:01.309
Basically, she had a reason
she couldn't turn herself in.

00:02:02.518 --> 00:02:04.395
It was all for Mr. Hyun.

00:02:05.396 --> 00:02:06.356
Mr. Hyun?

00:02:06.439 --> 00:02:08.149
I mean Dad.

00:02:09.984 --> 00:02:12.153
I called her dad "Mr. Hyun."

00:02:14.113 --> 00:02:15.406
But I don't know.

00:02:15.490 --> 00:02:17.659
That was really just an accident?

00:02:18.117 --> 00:02:18.993
It was a coincidence?

00:02:20.787 --> 00:02:23.289
And you want me
to believe that?

00:02:24.666 --> 00:02:25.583
What do you mean?

00:02:26.834 --> 00:02:29.587
Are you suspecting
that she caused the accident

00:02:30.129 --> 00:02:31.005
on purpose?

00:02:32.131 --> 00:02:33.091
Why not?

00:02:33.925 --> 00:02:37.053
Can't I have suspicions?
When you suspect others as you like?

00:02:37.971 --> 00:02:38.846
What?

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:41.933
You suspected that
Mr. Hyun and I were having an affair.

00:02:44.352 --> 00:02:46.437
Wasn't that why Ms. Cha suspected me too?

00:02:49.232 --> 00:02:50.316
I'm leaving.

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:52.902
Weren't you the one who asked to meet me?

00:02:55.238 --> 00:02:56.447
You still act like a princess.

00:02:59.409 --> 00:03:01.327
You said to me last time

00:03:01.411 --> 00:03:03.705
that you wanted to live an ordinary life.

00:03:04.747 --> 00:03:08.418
That you wanted to live
with ordinary parents.

00:03:08.501 --> 00:03:10.878
You wanted to quit
being the presidential candidate's

00:03:10.962 --> 00:03:12.588
and president's daughter whatnot.

00:03:12.672 --> 00:03:14.424
When you said that,

00:03:15.341 --> 00:03:17.260
do you know what went through my mind?

00:03:21.639 --> 00:03:23.057
"She's so ungrateful."

00:03:25.143 --> 00:03:27.270
Whenever you blabbered about how tough

00:03:27.353 --> 00:03:29.230
things were, do you know what I thought?

00:03:29.313 --> 00:03:32.150
"She's so spoiled and immature."

00:03:32.734 --> 00:03:34.068
Some people

00:03:35.403 --> 00:03:38.031
don't even get to have someone
who can spoil them.

00:03:41.075 --> 00:03:42.201
Even now,

00:03:43.828 --> 00:03:45.538
my mom is dead,

00:03:46.622 --> 00:03:49.167
and you're here acting like a baby.

00:03:56.215 --> 00:03:57.050
Ji-yu.

00:04:22.784 --> 00:04:23.993
I'm sorry.

00:04:24.994 --> 00:04:27.955
I wanted to apologize to you
in person in my mom's stead.

00:04:31.459 --> 00:04:33.628
I don't know if an apology will cut it.

00:04:35.421 --> 00:04:38.132
I don't deserve to receive an apology.

00:04:38.216 --> 00:04:39.467
That's not it.

00:04:39.550 --> 00:04:41.511
I'm not asking for forgiveness.

00:04:42.929 --> 00:04:44.305
The same goes for that.

00:04:45.223 --> 00:04:47.892
It's not up to me to forgive.

00:05:00.363 --> 00:05:01.322
Hyun Ji-yu.

00:05:03.366 --> 00:05:04.575
It's nice to see you here.

00:05:06.619 --> 00:05:08.663
Where are you going? You're leaving?

00:05:08.746 --> 00:05:10.415
Aren't you glad to see us again?

00:05:11.457 --> 00:05:13.042
She's the president's daughter.

00:05:14.210 --> 00:05:15.503
I can't believe we met here.

00:05:15.586 --> 00:05:17.130
I still owe you something.

00:05:17.213 --> 00:05:20.675
Shall we shoot the sequel?

00:05:20.758 --> 00:05:21.843
We definitely should.

00:05:21.926 --> 00:05:23.928
Let's stream it live.

00:05:24.011 --> 00:05:26.848
We'll make use
of the celebrity to get high views.

00:05:26.931 --> 00:05:28.057
Don't.

00:05:28.474 --> 00:05:30.643
Don't do what?

00:05:30.726 --> 00:05:31.727
Don't do what?

00:05:31.811 --> 00:05:33.187
You're so shameless.

00:05:33.271 --> 00:05:34.188
Hey.

00:05:34.647 --> 00:05:37.608
I'm suspended from school because you.
This is the least you can do.

00:05:37.692 --> 00:05:39.026
Don't you agree?

00:05:39.110 --> 00:05:41.904
Of course.
You should pay for what you did.

00:05:47.326 --> 00:05:48.995
Gang-myeong. An Gang-myeong!

00:05:53.499 --> 00:05:54.584
What're you doing? Get her!

00:06:03.176 --> 00:06:04.135
Hurry up!

00:06:42.632 --> 00:06:44.550
HYUN JI-YU

00:07:13.162 --> 00:07:14.330
Sit here.

00:07:15.456 --> 00:07:17.041
No, it's okay.

00:07:18.084 --> 00:07:20.628
Seeing you stand
makes me feel uncomfortable.

00:07:22.421 --> 00:07:23.548
Okay, then.

00:07:32.473 --> 00:07:33.432
Hold on to me.

00:07:38.729 --> 00:07:40.022
Are you okay?

00:07:40.106 --> 00:07:41.065
Yes.

00:07:42.358 --> 00:07:43.609
Thank you.

00:07:45.695 --> 00:07:48.322
You're very adept at it,
like a professional caregiver.

00:07:51.158 --> 00:07:52.577
My husband had

00:07:53.411 --> 00:07:55.413
a long rehabilitation period.

00:07:58.499 --> 00:08:02.628
When I first met you,
I thought you were very much like him.

00:08:03.838 --> 00:08:05.590
Now that you're in this state,

00:08:05.673 --> 00:08:06.799
you look even more like him.

00:08:09.594 --> 00:08:11.262
Do I?

00:08:12.221 --> 00:08:13.889
I don't see the resemblance.

00:08:15.099 --> 00:08:19.186
He was angry too, just like you.

00:08:19.270 --> 00:08:22.273
He wanted to take revenge
on the company for Tae-hun,

00:08:22.356 --> 00:08:24.400
who was denied worker's compensation.

00:08:24.942 --> 00:08:28.321
Just like how you wanted
to take revenge on me.

00:08:34.076 --> 00:08:36.662
Don't look at me like that.
It was the same for me.

00:08:38.372 --> 00:08:39.999
I also wanted to take revenge

00:08:40.082 --> 00:08:41.667
on my father.

00:08:43.294 --> 00:08:46.631
I wanted to take revenge on Father,
who drove Mom to an early grave

00:08:46.714 --> 00:08:49.342
to become an assemblyman.

00:08:50.593 --> 00:08:53.763
It's always anger that drives people.

00:08:53.846 --> 00:08:55.806
I realized that too young.

00:08:56.932 --> 00:08:59.226
So I was going to use your anger

00:09:01.062 --> 00:09:03.397
and your desire for revenge.

00:09:04.231 --> 00:09:05.316
But

00:09:06.817 --> 00:09:08.861
there's something I didn't know.

00:09:13.157 --> 00:09:14.575
Anger

00:09:14.659 --> 00:09:16.243
blinds you.

00:09:18.079 --> 00:09:19.997
And the first thing

00:09:20.623 --> 00:09:23.334
the blinded anger goes after

00:09:23.417 --> 00:09:26.629
is none other than myself.
I realized that too late.

00:09:33.386 --> 00:09:36.430
Losing someone precious to you.

00:09:36.972 --> 00:09:38.891
I guess I was too young to know

00:09:40.309 --> 00:09:41.477
what it felt like

00:09:42.103 --> 00:09:43.771
when my mom had died.

00:09:43.854 --> 00:09:44.897
But

00:09:47.233 --> 00:09:50.403
now that I could lose Ms. Sung,

00:09:52.613 --> 00:09:54.323
I can finally understand.

00:09:56.117 --> 00:09:57.243
I'm sorry.

00:10:00.162 --> 00:10:04.083
I knew from the start
that you lost your parents

00:10:04.166 --> 00:10:06.252
to the fire.

00:10:06.335 --> 00:10:08.462
I knew you were the family of the victims,

00:10:09.296 --> 00:10:10.423
but I tried to use you.

00:10:10.506 --> 00:10:11.924
You're sorry?

00:10:16.053 --> 00:10:17.722
Do you remember Song In-gyeong?

00:10:21.267 --> 00:10:22.768
You wouldn't.

00:10:23.394 --> 00:10:24.562
What about Kang In-gyu?

00:10:26.272 --> 00:10:28.566
Are they your late parents?

00:10:31.402 --> 00:10:33.070
You must've met them.

00:10:33.779 --> 00:10:36.657
Fifteen years ago,
when there was the fire,

00:10:37.616 --> 00:10:39.785
you were there too.

00:10:40.911 --> 00:10:45.499
Did you see why and how
my parents had died that day?

00:10:45.583 --> 00:10:46.709
Do you remember?

00:10:50.629 --> 00:10:53.716
At first, I doubted and hated Do Tae-hun.

00:10:55.926 --> 00:10:57.887
I believed what the media said

00:10:57.970 --> 00:11:00.556
and thought he'd killed my parents.

00:11:02.099 --> 00:11:02.933
But

00:11:03.017 --> 00:11:05.269
Uncle Ki-ju told me.

00:11:07.271 --> 00:11:09.231
It was someone else

00:11:09.315 --> 00:11:10.816
who killed my parents.

00:11:18.574 --> 00:11:19.700
Who

00:11:20.659 --> 00:11:22.203
is that?

00:11:23.496 --> 00:11:24.497
Who

00:11:25.498 --> 00:11:27.333
killed my parents?

00:11:34.882 --> 00:11:35.758
Was it you, Ms. Cha?

00:11:37.176 --> 00:11:38.552
Was it

00:11:39.178 --> 00:11:40.304
really you?

00:11:41.805 --> 00:11:46.560
The person standing on the receiving end
isn't Yang Hoon.

00:11:46.644 --> 00:11:48.354
It's Su-yeon.

00:11:50.689 --> 00:11:53.859
I just want to know the last moments
of my parents.

00:12:01.283 --> 00:12:02.368
Honey.

00:12:10.751 --> 00:12:11.585
I'm sorry,

00:12:12.711 --> 00:12:14.088
but I need to talk to my wife.

00:12:57.464 --> 00:12:58.841
I met the first lady.

00:13:02.052 --> 00:13:04.305
She said you were behind the fire.

00:13:05.848 --> 00:13:08.809
That you staged it with Yang Hoon

00:13:09.977 --> 00:13:12.062
so I could win the election.

00:13:12.146 --> 00:13:13.731
Is it true?

00:13:16.525 --> 00:13:18.444
Did you really do it?

00:13:22.406 --> 00:13:23.949
I did it.

00:13:25.075 --> 00:13:26.577
I killed them.

00:13:28.537 --> 00:13:29.663
You…

00:13:32.082 --> 00:13:33.250
It's true.

00:13:33.959 --> 00:13:35.961
Honey!

00:13:43.218 --> 00:13:44.928
Is that true?

00:13:45.679 --> 00:13:47.222
Was it really your doing?

00:13:55.272 --> 00:13:56.482
To win the election?

00:14:05.199 --> 00:14:06.533
It was all planned?

00:14:26.428 --> 00:14:28.180
I could become an assemblyman…

00:14:30.849 --> 00:14:32.351
and the president…

00:14:35.145 --> 00:14:36.939
because they lost their lives.

00:14:38.482 --> 00:14:39.566
Tae-hun.

00:14:40.609 --> 00:14:41.735
In-gyu.

00:14:42.736 --> 00:14:44.780
And In-gyeong. Their lost lives.

00:14:45.906 --> 00:14:46.991
When the doctor said

00:14:48.826 --> 00:14:51.912
you wouldn't be able to stand
and walk again,

00:14:52.997 --> 00:14:55.290
do you know what went through my mind?

00:14:57.126 --> 00:14:59.503
I thought about how strong a weapon

00:15:00.254 --> 00:15:02.881
it would be for your political career.

00:15:05.968 --> 00:15:07.845
Don't make that face.

00:15:10.848 --> 00:15:14.059
Had you become
permanently wheelchair-bound,

00:15:16.937 --> 00:15:19.481
you would've become the president

00:15:21.108 --> 00:15:22.484
five years ago, not now.

00:15:26.363 --> 00:15:28.240
I didn't love you.

00:15:30.868 --> 00:15:34.288
I just needed someone
to become the president.

00:15:35.330 --> 00:15:37.291
To drag down Cha Jeong-yeon

00:15:37.791 --> 00:15:39.877
and take revenge on my father.

00:15:41.420 --> 00:15:43.422
I used you.

00:16:17.748 --> 00:16:18.874
I'm sorry.

00:16:21.460 --> 00:16:23.087
I need some time to think.

00:16:25.631 --> 00:16:28.425
But the security rule says…

00:16:28.509 --> 00:16:29.843
Please.

00:16:33.889 --> 00:16:35.682
This will be my last request.

00:16:40.229 --> 00:16:42.606
Then we'll wait here.

00:17:15.973 --> 00:17:17.850
Will you be okay on your own?

00:17:18.642 --> 00:17:21.687
You kept making a fuss
saying you were okay,

00:17:22.229 --> 00:17:23.897
so I left.

00:17:23.981 --> 00:17:27.484
But leaving a patient to himself
makes me feel uneasy.

00:17:28.152 --> 00:17:30.404
Grandma, I'm not a patient.

00:17:30.487 --> 00:17:34.032
I'll be discharged in two days,
so just focus on your work.

00:17:34.700 --> 00:17:38.579
Don't leave your regular customers
to starve.

00:17:38.662 --> 00:17:41.248
Fine, then. Take good care of yourself.

00:17:41.331 --> 00:17:43.709
Make sure you eat the beef bone soup.

00:17:43.792 --> 00:17:45.335
I'm making more, so eat up.

00:17:45.419 --> 00:17:48.088
Beef bone soup is best to heal your bones.

00:17:48.172 --> 00:17:49.131
I'll visit tomorrow.

00:17:49.214 --> 00:17:50.716
Oh, Grandma.

00:17:52.593 --> 00:17:53.760
Do you have something to say?

00:18:02.519 --> 00:18:03.562
It's nothing.

00:18:04.813 --> 00:18:06.356
I wanted to say something,

00:18:08.442 --> 00:18:09.443
but I forgot.

00:18:10.319 --> 00:18:12.237
You silly.

00:18:12.821 --> 00:18:14.239
I'm hanging up.

00:18:14.323 --> 00:18:15.782
Take good care of yourself.

00:18:34.384 --> 00:18:35.844
That's rare

00:18:36.720 --> 00:18:38.972
for a car to drive all the way there.

00:18:39.723 --> 00:18:41.016
Ms. Sung.

00:18:44.061 --> 00:18:45.979
What should I do now?

00:18:50.150 --> 00:18:52.194
Why won't you say anything?

00:18:55.989 --> 00:18:58.450
You said you'd believe me,

00:19:00.118 --> 00:19:02.621
no matter what I did.

00:19:05.415 --> 00:19:07.542
You said you'd be on my side.

00:19:11.380 --> 00:19:13.298
Why won't you say anything?

00:19:37.906 --> 00:19:39.324
Ms. Sung.

00:19:48.292 --> 00:19:49.751
Ms. Sung.

00:20:04.558 --> 00:20:05.976
Hello, Ji-yu.

00:20:06.059 --> 00:20:08.061
Ms. Cha Su-yeon, listen carefully.

00:20:11.606 --> 00:20:12.774
Who is this?

00:20:12.858 --> 00:20:14.359
Why are you on Ji-yu's…

00:20:14.943 --> 00:20:16.945
Ji-yu is with me.

00:20:18.030 --> 00:20:19.156
Who are you?

00:20:19.823 --> 00:20:22.367
If you want to meet Ji-yu,
come over with the voice recorder.

00:20:24.036 --> 00:20:25.037
Yang Hoon?

00:20:25.537 --> 00:20:26.580
Is it Yang Hoon?

00:20:26.663 --> 00:20:27.748
Driver Kim is there, right?

00:20:30.042 --> 00:20:33.045
Hand your phone over to him
and follow him with the recorder.

00:20:35.881 --> 00:20:37.215
Driver Kim.

00:20:39.843 --> 00:20:41.928
This isn't what I think it is, right?

00:20:49.436 --> 00:20:50.896
Let me speak with Ji-yu.

00:20:51.521 --> 00:20:53.440
I need to make sure Ji-yu is safe first.

00:20:54.066 --> 00:20:55.817
Put Ji-yu on the phone now!

00:20:56.818 --> 00:20:57.819
Mom!

00:20:58.278 --> 00:21:00.489
Ji-yu, are you okay?

00:21:01.823 --> 00:21:03.408
Yes, I'm okay.

00:21:06.411 --> 00:21:08.205
I'll be there soon.

00:21:08.288 --> 00:21:10.999
I'll be there soon, so hang in there.

00:21:11.083 --> 00:21:12.042
Okay?

00:21:15.796 --> 00:21:18.048
Do as I say, and you can meet Ji-yu.

00:21:20.133 --> 00:21:21.885
I'll do as you say.

00:21:22.969 --> 00:21:24.721
So don't lay a finger on Ji-yu.

00:21:26.139 --> 00:21:28.183
If something happens to her,

00:21:31.144 --> 00:21:33.021
I'll kill you.

00:21:37.818 --> 00:21:39.236
Stay still.

00:21:48.578 --> 00:21:49.913
Why turn it off--

00:21:49.996 --> 00:21:51.832
You have the recorder, don't you?

00:21:53.834 --> 00:21:54.668
This way.

00:22:21.611 --> 00:22:22.571
My gosh!

00:22:33.456 --> 00:22:35.250
Wait for a while.

00:22:45.802 --> 00:22:48.638
I'll go to the Special Committee
and reveal the truth.

00:22:50.557 --> 00:22:52.225
The earlier, the better.

00:22:53.894 --> 00:22:57.230
See you at the Committee meeting
three days later.

00:23:07.240 --> 00:23:08.366
Thank you.

00:23:10.410 --> 00:23:12.245
Why are you here alone?

00:23:12.871 --> 00:23:14.039
Your bodyguards?

00:23:14.623 --> 00:23:17.167
What about them?
They always accompanied you.

00:23:18.710 --> 00:23:20.170
They need a break too.

00:23:21.213 --> 00:23:23.298
But what do you mean that you'll go

00:23:23.381 --> 00:23:25.675
to the Special Committee yourself?

00:23:30.096 --> 00:23:31.223
I'm sorry.

00:23:31.890 --> 00:23:33.308
Please wait for a few days.

00:23:38.230 --> 00:23:39.147
What I said

00:23:40.023 --> 00:23:41.858
at the charnel house last time.

00:23:43.026 --> 00:23:43.860
Forget that.

00:23:48.573 --> 00:23:51.618
Sun-jeong suddenly passed away,

00:23:52.869 --> 00:23:54.913
and I found out she had a daughter.

00:23:56.081 --> 00:23:58.625
Too many things happened at once,

00:23:59.960 --> 00:24:00.961
so I couldn't

00:24:01.670 --> 00:24:04.005
be considerate of your feelings.

00:24:04.881 --> 00:24:06.967
I'm sure you were upset too.

00:24:13.014 --> 00:24:14.641
I was grateful.

00:24:14.724 --> 00:24:16.351
What?

00:24:16.434 --> 00:24:18.770
You scolded me

00:24:19.729 --> 00:24:21.940
like I was still your son.

00:24:22.857 --> 00:24:23.858
I was…

00:24:25.944 --> 00:24:27.237
grateful and glad for it.

00:24:27.821 --> 00:24:30.323
You feel glad for anything and everything.

00:24:33.285 --> 00:24:34.911
Scold me as much as you like.

00:24:35.829 --> 00:24:37.747
Reprimand me as much as you like.

00:24:39.416 --> 00:24:41.001
I've more things left for you to scold.

00:24:43.336 --> 00:24:45.255
You should scold me

00:24:46.965 --> 00:24:48.800
so that making Tae-hun die…

00:24:51.344 --> 00:24:52.929
Because of me, Tae-hun…

00:24:54.097 --> 00:24:56.016
The noodles will get soggy. Eat up.

00:24:56.099 --> 00:24:59.686
I won't disturb you. Start eating.

00:25:09.821 --> 00:25:10.947
What's happening?

00:25:11.031 --> 00:25:13.241
The neighborhood thugs
or shady-looking kids

00:25:13.325 --> 00:25:15.076
would come occasionally,

00:25:15.160 --> 00:25:18.163
but cars are driving in
one after another today.

00:25:24.586 --> 00:25:26.046
WIFE

00:25:28.131 --> 00:25:30.175
The person you called is unavailable.

00:25:49.194 --> 00:25:50.028
Ji-yu!

00:25:51.488 --> 00:25:52.530
Ji-yu!

00:25:55.075 --> 00:25:56.076
Are you okay?

00:25:57.869 --> 00:25:59.454
Are you hurt anywhere?

00:25:59.537 --> 00:26:01.081
Mom, I'm sorry.

00:26:01.164 --> 00:26:04.042
Why would you be sorry? I'm sorry.

00:26:04.125 --> 00:26:05.293
Are you hurt anywhere?

00:26:05.377 --> 00:26:06.336
No.

00:26:10.924 --> 00:26:13.385
Goodness.

00:26:13.468 --> 00:26:15.512
This is my favorite scene.

00:26:17.972 --> 00:26:19.766
I almost missed it.

00:26:21.768 --> 00:26:22.936
What do you want?

00:26:38.201 --> 00:26:39.119
Goal.

00:26:41.621 --> 00:26:42.831
Let Ji-yu go.

00:26:43.456 --> 00:26:44.582
Then I'll keep

00:26:44.666 --> 00:26:46.668
my mouth shut forever as you wish.

00:26:48.086 --> 00:26:49.379
You're the evidence.

00:26:50.588 --> 00:26:51.840
I should get rid of it.

00:26:52.382 --> 00:26:54.759
I can't live worrying about it forever.

00:26:55.593 --> 00:26:58.555
The historic moment from 15 years ago

00:26:58.638 --> 00:27:01.349
that dominated the news

00:27:01.933 --> 00:27:03.893
will hit the headlines again.

00:27:05.103 --> 00:27:06.771
I'll do whatever you say.

00:27:07.272 --> 00:27:08.523
Just spare Ji-yu.

00:27:09.274 --> 00:27:10.233
Let, let Ji-yu go.

00:27:10.316 --> 00:27:11.234
Mom!

00:27:11.317 --> 00:27:13.111
This has nothing to do with her!

00:27:14.362 --> 00:27:16.448
It had nothing to do with the old woman

00:27:16.531 --> 00:27:17.740
who got in the accident.

00:27:23.246 --> 00:27:24.122
Please, I beg you.

00:27:24.205 --> 00:27:26.708
Yang Hoon, please just spare Ji-yu.

00:27:26.791 --> 00:27:28.209
Let her go!

00:27:29.794 --> 00:27:30.962
Darn it.

00:27:33.256 --> 00:27:34.299
Are you serious?

00:27:35.884 --> 00:27:38.678
I respected you so much,
and you're begging me

00:27:39.554 --> 00:27:41.389
just to spare your kid?

00:27:43.433 --> 00:27:45.143
Just spare Ji-yu, Yang Hoon.

00:27:45.226 --> 00:27:47.687
I beg you. Spare her, Yang Hoon!

00:27:49.147 --> 00:27:51.316
Are you going to burn the place down?

00:27:51.399 --> 00:27:53.067
Do you think you can get away with this?

00:27:53.693 --> 00:27:54.944
Fire?

00:27:55.028 --> 00:27:56.279
That won't work.

00:27:56.362 --> 00:27:58.573
Firefighters arrive very quickly nowadays.

00:28:01.618 --> 00:28:04.996
Everyone thinks fire itself kills people,

00:28:05.079 --> 00:28:07.081
but the one that's really dangerous

00:28:07.165 --> 00:28:08.541
is toxic gas.

00:28:11.002 --> 00:28:12.545
I'm the CEO

00:28:12.629 --> 00:28:14.380
of a chemical plant, you see.

00:28:17.217 --> 00:28:18.176
This is

00:28:18.801 --> 00:28:20.470
phosgene.

00:28:20.553 --> 00:28:23.431
And it's very dangerous.

00:28:23.515 --> 00:28:25.225
No.

00:28:25.934 --> 00:28:27.894
Mr. Jung, finish this.

00:28:28.561 --> 00:28:30.271
-Yes, sir.
-Yang Hoon!

00:28:30.355 --> 00:28:31.439
Yang Hoon!

00:28:48.623 --> 00:28:51.543
They say fire is the best sight to watch.

00:28:53.461 --> 00:28:54.295
It's nothing much.

00:28:55.839 --> 00:28:56.881
Yang Hoon.

00:28:56.965 --> 00:28:59.050
Gosh, you startled me.

00:28:59.926 --> 00:29:00.969
I'm sorry.

00:29:01.052 --> 00:29:03.680
Repent all you want in there.

00:29:04.514 --> 00:29:05.849
Have fun with your daughter.

00:29:06.516 --> 00:29:10.478
At least the mom and the daughter
will be together until the end.

00:29:11.521 --> 00:29:12.939
That makes me feel relieved.

00:29:13.648 --> 00:29:14.816
Just let Ji-yu go.

00:29:17.026 --> 00:29:18.236
Please let her go!

00:29:18.319 --> 00:29:19.153
Yang Hoon!

00:29:19.612 --> 00:29:21.072
Yang Hoon, open the door!

00:29:21.155 --> 00:29:22.407
Open the door!

00:29:23.449 --> 00:29:24.742
Let Ji-yu go!

00:29:24.826 --> 00:29:27.370
Yang Hoon, let Ji-yu go!

00:29:49.517 --> 00:29:51.352
Mom, I'm sorry. It's my fault.

00:29:51.436 --> 00:29:54.480
Shush, don't say anything.
You can't breathe in the gas.

00:29:58.735 --> 00:30:00.069
There's someone here!

00:30:42.946 --> 00:30:44.322
Save me.

00:30:46.699 --> 00:30:48.076
Mom.

00:30:48.159 --> 00:30:50.161
-Did you hear that too?
-Yes.

00:30:50.244 --> 00:30:51.829
There's someone here.

00:30:54.916 --> 00:30:56.250
Save me.

00:31:13.893 --> 00:31:14.852
Honey!

00:31:23.194 --> 00:31:24.153
Ji-yu.

00:31:24.904 --> 00:31:26.280
Ji-yu!

00:31:28.825 --> 00:31:30.118
Ji-yu.

00:31:43.339 --> 00:31:44.424
Ji-yu.

00:31:45.008 --> 00:31:46.926
Ji-yu. Hyun Ji-yu.

00:31:56.519 --> 00:31:57.478
Ji-yu.

00:31:59.188 --> 00:32:00.148
Ji-yu.

00:32:00.898 --> 00:32:01.816
Ji-yu. Hyun Ji-yu.

00:32:04.360 --> 00:32:05.194
Dad.

00:32:06.612 --> 00:32:07.822
Dad is here.

00:32:07.905 --> 00:32:09.198
I'm here, so don't worry.

00:32:09.782 --> 00:32:11.200
You'll be fine soon.

00:32:11.617 --> 00:32:12.493
Where's Mom?

00:32:16.539 --> 00:32:17.999
Mom…

00:32:18.082 --> 00:32:19.208
Can you go alone?

00:32:19.292 --> 00:32:20.668
No, don't go.

00:32:20.752 --> 00:32:22.545
I'll take her and get out soon.

00:32:22.628 --> 00:32:24.672
It's dangerous here. Wait outside.

00:32:25.214 --> 00:32:28.176
You'll go back in there
when you don't even know who she is?

00:32:28.885 --> 00:32:30.011
You can't.

00:32:31.971 --> 00:32:34.057
What would Dad have done?

00:32:36.976 --> 00:32:38.352
If Dad were here,

00:32:38.436 --> 00:32:40.354
he'd never give up on saving someone.

00:32:41.856 --> 00:32:42.774
Mom.

00:32:47.153 --> 00:32:48.279
I'll be back soon.

00:32:50.073 --> 00:32:51.032
Mom.

00:32:52.033 --> 00:32:54.410
She was with me until just now.

00:32:56.829 --> 00:32:59.165
She went back in to save someone.

00:33:01.584 --> 00:33:03.836
I'll go get her. Wait here.

00:33:41.124 --> 00:33:42.250
Lee Hwa-jin?

00:33:42.792 --> 00:33:43.876
What should I do?

00:33:43.960 --> 00:33:47.171
If there's a victim,
there should be a perpetrator.

00:33:47.255 --> 00:33:50.675
She killed Cha Su-yeon and her daughter
to avenge her mom

00:33:50.758 --> 00:33:52.218
and died herself too.

00:33:52.301 --> 00:33:53.469
It's neat.

00:33:53.553 --> 00:33:54.470
Yes, sir.

00:33:55.012 --> 00:33:55.847
Text a will

00:33:56.139 --> 00:33:58.474
to her friend
and get rid of them all here.

00:34:00.601 --> 00:34:02.687
Lee Hwa-jin!

00:34:08.484 --> 00:34:09.610
Ms. Cha.

00:34:33.926 --> 00:34:35.428
Don't worry.

00:34:35.511 --> 00:34:36.679
We can go out.

00:34:54.822 --> 00:34:55.823
Lee Hwa-jin.

00:34:56.324 --> 00:34:57.283
Hwa-jin!

00:35:05.124 --> 00:35:06.334
I'll do it.

00:35:06.417 --> 00:35:07.418
Honey.

00:35:07.501 --> 00:35:09.420
Stand back. I'll open it quickly.

00:35:37.323 --> 00:35:38.908
Are you okay? Are you hurt?

00:35:38.991 --> 00:35:39.992
I'm fine.

00:35:40.701 --> 00:35:41.744
What about Ji-yu?

00:35:41.827 --> 00:35:42.954
Ji-yu is fine too.

00:35:43.496 --> 00:35:44.372
Let's go.

00:35:44.872 --> 00:35:45.790
Wait.

00:35:46.332 --> 00:35:47.291
Hwa-jin.

00:35:47.375 --> 00:35:48.542
Hwa-jin?

00:35:48.626 --> 00:35:51.462
She passed out.

00:35:52.588 --> 00:35:53.506
Here.

00:35:54.340 --> 00:35:55.675
-Hwa-jin.
-Hwa-jin.

00:35:55.758 --> 00:35:57.134
-Lee Hwa-jin.
-Lee Hwa-jin.

00:35:58.511 --> 00:35:59.470
Hwa-jin.

00:36:11.232 --> 00:36:12.358
Watch out!

00:36:59.196 --> 00:37:00.197
Lee Hwa-jin.

00:37:01.073 --> 00:37:01.991
Hwa-jin.

00:37:02.783 --> 00:37:03.784
Hwa-jin.

00:37:08.789 --> 00:37:09.832
Can you hear me?

00:37:31.228 --> 00:37:32.146
Honey.

00:37:37.777 --> 00:37:38.736
Honey.

00:37:39.362 --> 00:37:40.738
Give me a second.

00:37:40.821 --> 00:37:42.323
I'll get you out soon.

00:38:05.721 --> 00:38:06.680
Honey.

00:38:09.725 --> 00:38:12.353
I'm sorry. Because of me, Yang Hoon…

00:38:15.731 --> 00:38:16.899
Don't be sorry.

00:38:19.026 --> 00:38:20.736
I should've known

00:38:22.405 --> 00:38:24.198
why you did that.

00:38:24.990 --> 00:38:26.575
I should've known.

00:38:27.576 --> 00:38:28.869
I'm sorry.

00:38:30.454 --> 00:38:31.497
No.

00:38:32.373 --> 00:38:35.167
You did nothing wrong. Don't say that.

00:38:35.251 --> 00:38:37.002
Do you still not get it?

00:38:38.879 --> 00:38:40.423
My biggest fault

00:38:41.048 --> 00:38:42.800
is that I didn't know.

00:38:44.552 --> 00:38:46.887
I of all people should've known

00:38:48.180 --> 00:38:50.891
what you did and why you did it.

00:38:51.559 --> 00:38:55.020
What my loved one did and why.

00:38:56.480 --> 00:38:57.857
I should've known.

00:39:02.862 --> 00:39:03.821
Honey.

00:39:18.878 --> 00:39:19.795
Honey.

00:39:22.923 --> 00:39:24.592
The building is cracking.

00:39:25.468 --> 00:39:27.678
It could collapse at any time. So…

00:39:31.599 --> 00:39:32.933
take Hwa-jin and leave.

00:39:41.317 --> 00:39:42.485
No.

00:39:43.527 --> 00:39:44.528
I won't.

00:39:48.324 --> 00:39:49.533
Take the girl and leave.

00:39:49.617 --> 00:39:50.576
I don't want to.

00:39:51.243 --> 00:39:52.411
Now. There's no time.

00:39:52.495 --> 00:39:53.662
No!

00:39:53.746 --> 00:39:55.498
No!

00:39:55.998 --> 00:39:56.957
No!

00:39:57.875 --> 00:39:59.710
-I won't!
-There's no time. Go now!

00:39:59.793 --> 00:40:01.545
No, I won't!

00:40:01.629 --> 00:40:04.423
Just wait. I can do this!

00:40:06.050 --> 00:40:07.051
-Honey.
-No.

00:40:08.135 --> 00:40:09.220
Think about Ji-yu.

00:40:09.303 --> 00:40:11.138
No, honey. Don't do this.

00:40:11.222 --> 00:40:12.515
No.

00:40:12.598 --> 00:40:13.933
Don't do this.

00:40:14.016 --> 00:40:15.601
Go out with her. Don't give up.

00:40:15.684 --> 00:40:17.144
I can't leave without you.

00:40:17.228 --> 00:40:20.272
No, don't do this.
Please don't do this to me.

00:40:20.856 --> 00:40:22.191
-No.
-I'll leave it to you.

00:40:23.192 --> 00:40:24.777
-No.
-Go now!

00:40:35.120 --> 00:40:37.581
Ji-yu is waiting. Get out now.

00:40:54.348 --> 00:40:56.559
Honey, hang in there. I'll be back soon.

00:40:56.642 --> 00:40:58.602
Just hang in there for a bit.

00:40:58.686 --> 00:41:00.563
Okay? I'll be back soon.

00:41:02.815 --> 00:41:04.733
Get up. Let's go.

00:41:04.817 --> 00:41:06.318
Stand up.

00:41:06.402 --> 00:41:08.320
-Dad.
-Stand up now.

00:41:16.829 --> 00:41:17.871
Dad.

00:41:20.291 --> 00:41:21.584
Dad.

00:41:38.017 --> 00:41:39.226
You have a photo, right?

00:41:59.079 --> 00:42:00.122
Goodness.

00:42:00.706 --> 00:42:04.335
Your daughter looks just like your wife.

00:42:07.713 --> 00:42:09.506
Don't be too disappointed, though.

00:42:09.590 --> 00:42:12.384
Now that I take a closer look,
she has your eyes.

00:42:32.988 --> 00:42:34.448
You worked hard.

00:42:50.923 --> 00:42:52.800
Do you know how rough it was?

00:42:57.388 --> 00:42:59.264
I really had a hard time.

00:43:03.352 --> 00:43:04.520
I know.

00:43:05.938 --> 00:43:06.772
I really--

00:43:06.855 --> 00:43:08.065
You did…

00:43:10.567 --> 00:43:12.111
a great job.

00:43:34.925 --> 00:43:36.093
I'm sorry.

00:45:33.043 --> 00:45:34.044
You're awake.

00:45:35.712 --> 00:45:37.130
Why're you sleeping like this?

00:45:39.132 --> 00:45:40.425
I came home late.

00:45:41.677 --> 00:45:43.554
I was going to rest for five minutes.

00:45:44.846 --> 00:45:47.182
But I was too tired and fell asleep.

00:45:47.266 --> 00:45:49.017
You must be very tired.

00:45:49.101 --> 00:45:51.061
Sleep comfortably on the bed.

00:45:53.355 --> 00:45:54.356
Just five minutes.

00:45:55.107 --> 00:45:56.650
Let's stay like this for five.

00:45:57.401 --> 00:45:59.736
You have an appointment at dawn.

00:45:59.820 --> 00:46:00.779
Get up now.

00:46:00.862 --> 00:46:02.030
Then one minute.

00:46:37.399 --> 00:46:38.358
What is it?

00:46:41.653 --> 00:46:43.155
Why look at me that way?

00:46:44.489 --> 00:46:45.949
Is something on my face?

00:46:48.785 --> 00:46:49.828
Honey.

00:46:58.587 --> 00:47:00.339
Are you really here?

00:47:05.302 --> 00:47:07.596
It's the shortest minute in the world.

00:48:13.412 --> 00:48:14.705
Ms. Cha?

00:48:23.296 --> 00:48:24.756
Where's my husband?

00:49:00.417 --> 00:49:04.212
Yang was arrested warrantless
for setting the old factory on fire.

00:49:04.296 --> 00:49:06.423
I don't know anything. It wasn't me!

00:49:06.506 --> 00:49:08.049
Yang denied his charge,

00:49:08.633 --> 00:49:11.762
but Jung and Kim who were arrested
for setting the fire

00:49:11.845 --> 00:49:14.931
as per Yang's orders admitted their crime.

00:49:16.057 --> 00:49:18.477
They kidnapped President-elect's daughter,

00:49:18.560 --> 00:49:20.437
lured Ms. Cha to the factory,

00:49:20.520 --> 00:49:22.939
and tried to kill them
by starting the fire.

00:49:24.608 --> 00:49:25.650
The police secured

00:49:25.734 --> 00:49:29.029
evidence that Yang was involved in
the car accident a few days ago

00:49:29.112 --> 00:49:30.572
and are interrogating him.

00:49:36.495 --> 00:49:39.247
Ms. Cha and her daughter
were rescued safely,

00:49:39.331 --> 00:49:42.167
but President-elect,
who saved his family from the fire,

00:49:42.250 --> 00:49:43.835
went missing.

00:49:44.503 --> 00:49:47.631
The search authorities are
continuing the search for two days,

00:49:47.714 --> 00:49:50.801
but some are expressing their concerns

00:49:50.884 --> 00:49:52.761
that the golden hour has already passed.

00:49:54.471 --> 00:49:56.056
-Dad.
-Stand up now.

00:49:56.640 --> 00:49:57.808
Dad.

00:50:14.032 --> 00:50:15.158
Ms. Sung

00:50:16.952 --> 00:50:19.538
wanted to talk to you about your mom.

00:50:22.916 --> 00:50:25.126
About my mom?

00:50:28.046 --> 00:50:29.089
I'm sorry.

00:50:30.006 --> 00:50:30.841
What?

00:50:32.342 --> 00:50:34.052
Why're you suddenly apologizing?

00:50:35.387 --> 00:50:37.514
On the day of the accident,

00:50:37.597 --> 00:50:38.807
I chased

00:50:40.308 --> 00:50:41.726
after your mom.

00:50:44.604 --> 00:50:46.189
You chased after my mom?

00:50:47.566 --> 00:50:49.025
To see her daughter…

00:50:51.361 --> 00:50:53.947
To see her daughter even from a distance,

00:50:55.991 --> 00:50:59.286
she came by for the whole week,
and I spotted her.

00:51:01.496 --> 00:51:02.455
But

00:51:03.415 --> 00:51:06.209
she ran away when I recognized her.

00:52:08.396 --> 00:52:10.690
Mom came

00:52:10.774 --> 00:52:12.525
to see me?

00:52:14.235 --> 00:52:15.362
I'm sure of it.

00:52:16.905 --> 00:52:18.323
This old woman here

00:52:18.949 --> 00:52:21.159
got too scared.

00:52:24.371 --> 00:52:25.830
I ended up running away.

00:52:27.248 --> 00:52:28.083
I'm sorry.

00:52:30.085 --> 00:52:31.169
I'm sorry.

00:52:34.255 --> 00:52:35.382
I'm sorry.

00:52:45.016 --> 00:52:49.896
TESTIMONY BY SHIN HAE-RIN

00:53:11.751 --> 00:53:13.128
What about President-elect?

00:53:17.507 --> 00:53:18.591
He's still missing?

00:53:26.766 --> 00:53:30.061
The unprecedented situation
of President-elect being missing

00:53:30.145 --> 00:53:32.772
made the politicians dumbfounded.

00:53:33.356 --> 00:53:35.859
Both the Participation People's party

00:53:35.942 --> 00:53:38.903
and Party for Peace and Freedom
are wishing for his safe return.

00:53:38.987 --> 00:53:42.615
The Presidential Transition Committee
hasn't announced their stance,

00:53:42.699 --> 00:53:45.744
except that they're sticking to
their transitioning duties.

00:53:57.464 --> 00:53:58.339
Hello?

00:53:58.423 --> 00:53:59.340
How's the Committee?

00:54:00.633 --> 00:54:01.468
Secretary Shin.

00:54:02.052 --> 00:54:04.220
I heard Ms. Cha was attending it.

00:54:04.721 --> 00:54:05.555
Yes.

00:54:06.473 --> 00:54:08.141
She'll attend on the day

00:54:08.224 --> 00:54:09.434
Mr. Hyun was supposed to.

00:54:10.226 --> 00:54:12.395
She has something to say about the fire.

00:54:14.856 --> 00:54:16.066
Minister nominations?

00:54:20.445 --> 00:54:22.447
The inauguration is around the corner.

00:54:22.530 --> 00:54:24.407
President-elect has high standards.

00:54:24.491 --> 00:54:25.784
You must check thoroughly.

00:54:27.243 --> 00:54:28.453
Don't worry.

00:54:29.704 --> 00:54:32.582
I'm handling all the tasks
you used to work on.

00:54:33.625 --> 00:54:37.754
President-elect
doesn't accept sloppy work.

00:54:37.837 --> 00:54:39.714
I'm working like there's no weekends.

00:54:40.715 --> 00:54:42.634
I'm losing so much weight.

00:54:46.638 --> 00:54:49.099
I thought you could wear one of these
to go to the Committee.

00:54:50.266 --> 00:54:53.311
Since the occasion is such…

00:54:57.857 --> 00:54:59.150
He…

00:55:00.902 --> 00:55:02.237
is alive.

00:55:05.115 --> 00:55:05.949
I apologize.

00:55:12.163 --> 00:55:14.541
Ms. Cha attended
the Special Committee meeting

00:55:14.624 --> 00:55:17.252
this afternoon in President-elect's stead.

00:55:17.335 --> 00:55:19.754
Ms. Cha was accused of being involved

00:55:19.838 --> 00:55:22.507
with Chairman Yang Hoon of H Chemical.

00:55:22.590 --> 00:55:25.176
People are wondering
if she'll reveal the truth.

00:55:25.260 --> 00:55:26.761
The contract workers

00:55:27.971 --> 00:55:30.431
and the police who forced their way

00:55:31.099 --> 00:55:32.725
into the factory to drag out

00:55:33.768 --> 00:55:37.063
the sit-in protesters
caused the fire 15 years ago.

00:55:37.981 --> 00:55:41.985
Do Tae-hun and other union members
were innocent victims.

00:55:42.068 --> 00:55:43.653
So are the six people

00:55:43.736 --> 00:55:47.115
who were at the scene of the fire,
including Song In-gyeong

00:55:47.198 --> 00:55:48.616
and Kang In-gyu.

00:55:49.576 --> 00:55:51.327
They died wrongful deaths.

00:55:55.456 --> 00:55:56.583
And they're innocent.

00:56:00.920 --> 00:56:02.714
If what you're saying is true,

00:56:02.797 --> 00:56:04.132
you yourself

00:56:04.799 --> 00:56:06.926
won't be free from the responsibility.

00:56:08.887 --> 00:56:12.682
I already made the same statement
to the police.

00:56:13.808 --> 00:56:15.602
I won't hide

00:56:15.685 --> 00:56:17.103
or run anymore.

00:56:18.479 --> 00:56:20.231
I'll take responsibility.

00:56:20.315 --> 00:56:22.525
I'll accept the punishment too.

00:56:22.609 --> 00:56:23.943
But

00:56:24.027 --> 00:56:27.071
Yang Hoon and the contractors
aren't the only criminals.

00:56:27.155 --> 00:56:29.490
Late Cha Jin-taek
of Party for Peace and Freedom

00:56:29.574 --> 00:56:32.452
framed innocent Do Tae-hun
to be the perpetrator.

00:56:34.078 --> 00:56:35.705
So did President Yu Jin-myeong.

00:56:36.873 --> 00:56:40.960
The person who leaked the fabricated
investigation result to the media and

00:56:41.044 --> 00:56:43.421
is present here
as the special committee member.

00:56:44.047 --> 00:56:45.715
Noh Cheol-jae, the prosecutor back then.

00:56:48.635 --> 00:56:49.469
Witness!

00:56:50.178 --> 00:56:51.012
Do you have proof?

00:56:51.095 --> 00:56:52.889
Remember the oath you took!

00:56:52.972 --> 00:56:56.392
You'll be punished for perjury
if you give a false statement.

00:56:56.476 --> 00:56:58.394
I have the transaction history between

00:56:58.478 --> 00:57:01.648
him and Yang Hoon,
plus the recordings of our phone calls.

00:57:01.731 --> 00:57:05.193
If it's evidence you want,
I can give it to you right now.

00:57:08.863 --> 00:57:09.739
Mr. Noh.

00:57:10.323 --> 00:57:11.950
Take your seat.

00:57:12.033 --> 00:57:14.202
This time is for the witness.

00:57:20.583 --> 00:57:23.086
Lastly, the media
that influenced the public

00:57:23.169 --> 00:57:25.880
by reporting
the fabricated investigation result

00:57:26.548 --> 00:57:28.841
as if it's true
without checking the facts.

00:57:33.805 --> 00:57:34.806
All of them

00:57:35.682 --> 00:57:36.975
must be responsible.

00:57:40.645 --> 00:57:41.729
I understand.

00:57:42.647 --> 00:57:46.568
The Special Committee
will investigate that too.

00:57:47.277 --> 00:57:50.947
Thank you for testifying for a long time.

00:57:51.864 --> 00:57:53.866
Is there anything else you want to say?

00:57:53.950 --> 00:57:55.201
I'll give you time.

00:58:04.836 --> 00:58:06.379
My husband said

00:58:07.839 --> 00:58:10.633
to change the world,
he himself should change first.

00:58:12.010 --> 00:58:13.678
To change the world,

00:58:14.387 --> 00:58:15.972
you must change yourself first.

00:58:17.056 --> 00:58:19.642
By changing one person like that,

00:58:19.726 --> 00:58:21.060
you change the world.

00:58:22.228 --> 00:58:24.147
By saving one person like that,

00:58:24.230 --> 00:58:25.773
you save the world.

00:58:26.399 --> 00:58:27.567
Because

00:58:27.650 --> 00:58:29.527
each and every person

00:58:31.613 --> 00:58:33.072
is the world.

00:58:34.073 --> 00:58:37.327
Changing and saving the world.

00:58:39.329 --> 00:58:42.165
He didn't do politics
with such grandiose hope.

00:58:43.458 --> 00:58:45.293
My husband did politics

00:58:47.629 --> 00:58:50.256
because he was afraid that the world

00:58:50.340 --> 00:58:52.175
would change him.

00:58:54.344 --> 00:58:56.888
He was afraid he'd turn a blind eye
to the injured,

00:58:58.598 --> 00:59:01.851
that he'd turn his back on the coworker
who's fighting alone,

00:59:02.894 --> 00:59:05.396
and that he'd use his family and daughter

00:59:05.480 --> 00:59:08.191
as excuses to sacrifice someone

00:59:08.274 --> 00:59:10.401
and become happy on his own.

00:59:31.422 --> 00:59:32.799
I knew from the beginning

00:59:32.882 --> 00:59:35.551
that he didn't give up on anyone,
not a single person.

00:59:37.011 --> 00:59:38.137
That's why

00:59:39.639 --> 00:59:41.057
I loved him.

00:59:43.601 --> 00:59:44.852
My father

00:59:44.936 --> 00:59:47.855
sacrificed my mom
to become an assemblyman.

00:59:48.481 --> 00:59:51.567
My husband wouldn't let
anyone sacrifice themselves,

00:59:51.651 --> 00:59:55.196
even if that meant
he'd become the president.

00:59:57.031 --> 00:59:58.658
That's why

00:59:59.450 --> 01:00:00.868
I married him.

01:00:11.337 --> 01:00:14.465
I don't know
if my husband saved the world.

01:00:16.384 --> 01:00:17.552
But he did save

01:00:18.219 --> 01:00:20.888
a person's life.

01:00:22.140 --> 01:00:24.058
He saved me.

01:00:26.269 --> 01:00:27.937
I don't know if my husband

01:00:29.397 --> 01:00:30.732
changed the world.

01:00:33.234 --> 01:00:35.486
But he changed me.

01:00:38.448 --> 01:00:39.490
It's my turn now.

01:00:40.742 --> 01:00:42.827
It's my turn to save him.

01:00:44.454 --> 01:00:45.747
To me, he is…

01:00:51.961 --> 01:00:53.087
My whole world.

01:00:56.632 --> 01:00:57.884
He will

01:00:58.509 --> 01:00:59.552
definitely

01:01:00.762 --> 01:01:02.054
come back.

01:01:35.963 --> 01:01:38.925
Ms. Sung made this for you.

01:01:40.384 --> 01:01:42.261
She's a patient herself.

01:01:42.345 --> 01:01:43.554
She shouldn't have.

01:01:52.104 --> 01:01:52.980
Is he the baby's dad?

01:01:59.570 --> 01:02:01.614
I really can't get used to it.

01:02:01.697 --> 01:02:03.658
That he's the baby's dad

01:02:04.742 --> 01:02:05.785
and I am

01:02:06.369 --> 01:02:07.954
a mom.

01:02:15.378 --> 01:02:17.088
When Ji-yu was young,

01:02:17.880 --> 01:02:20.258
she loved a tricycle.

01:02:21.634 --> 01:02:24.387
She'd always say that we three as a family

01:02:25.012 --> 01:02:26.931
were like a tricycle.

01:02:31.143 --> 01:02:35.273
You, him, and the baby
are now a tricycle too.

01:02:36.399 --> 01:02:37.733
Get used to it soon.

01:02:39.694 --> 01:02:40.736
Are we?

01:02:43.948 --> 01:02:46.367
It's cold and windy. You should go back.

01:02:47.076 --> 01:02:47.994
Then

01:02:49.954 --> 01:02:51.122
wear this at least.

01:03:03.175 --> 01:03:04.385
It looks good on you.

01:03:19.191 --> 01:03:20.693
Here! He's here!

01:03:21.319 --> 01:03:22.361
Over here!

01:03:29.243 --> 01:03:31.287
Secure airway, check for injuries!

01:03:31.829 --> 01:03:32.872
Check for breathing!
