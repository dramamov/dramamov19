[Whispers of Fate]

00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:29.910
[Episode 14]

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:36.979
Take it.

00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:40.509
[Wanted]

00:01:40.509 --> 00:01:41.560
They captured your traits.

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:42.820
It looks just like you.

00:01:46.479 --> 00:01:48.080
And it looks like you as well.

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:56.310
This one's the most accurate.

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:57.710
Who's this thug with the mean, fat face?

00:01:57.710 --> 00:01:59.110
Which bastard drew this?

00:01:59.590 --> 00:02:00.200
Chi Yun,

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:01.500
keep it down.

00:02:01.870 --> 00:02:03.270
Don't expose ourselves.

00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:08.419
Do I still need this disguise?

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:09.190
Who's this?

00:02:09.370 --> 00:02:10.120
Ask them.

00:02:10.150 --> 00:02:11.080
Just ask them...

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:15.420
You're Chi Yun!

00:02:15.710 --> 00:02:16.190
Guys!

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:17.680
Catch them!

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:21.770
Where are they?

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:22.710
Where did they go?

00:02:22.710 --> 00:02:23.370
Over there!

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:24.240
Go after them!

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:25.030
Let's go! After them!

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:25.910
Check over there!

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:27.170
After them! Follow me!

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:30.530
Shen, you...

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:31.630
Chi Yun,

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:34.410
you've dragged us down again.

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:36.280
From this portrait,

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:37.710
he could recognize me?

00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:39.980
I told you yours was the most accurate.

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:52.090
These are gourd chicken,

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:53.060
mixed stir-fry,

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:54.010
clay-pot fish,

00:02:54.010 --> 00:02:55.240
Ziyang steamed platter,

00:02:55.240 --> 00:02:56.470
and warm shredded duck salad.

00:02:56.470 --> 00:02:57.240
Sirs,

00:02:57.450 --> 00:02:58.470
all dishes have been served.

00:02:58.470 --> 00:02:59.400
Enjoy your meal.

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:00.850
Foxy Tang,

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:01.910
you don't look like

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:03.340
someone who's wanted at all.

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:05.540
You're clearly here to enjoy yourself.

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:08.240
You're right.

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:12.410
What's this?

00:03:13.210 --> 00:03:14.730
From Jinzhou to Sanqin,

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:16.240
there are myriad delicacies.

00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:17.680
I need careful notes to make sure

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:18.829
I don't miss anything.

00:03:18.829 --> 00:03:20.160
Missing out on good food

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:21.810
would be a lifelong regret.

00:03:21.960 --> 00:03:23.280
You really made

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:24.240
a food map.

00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:26.150
Let me take a look.

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:35.960
What's this? It's so good!

00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:38.070
This is called honey-glazed balls,

00:03:38.070 --> 00:03:39.760
made with flour and eggs,

00:03:40.030 --> 00:03:41.290
coated in honey sauce,

00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:42.520
crispy outside, soft inside,

00:03:42.520 --> 00:03:43.700
not only sweet but also fragrant.

00:03:43.700 --> 00:03:45.960
It's a popular dish in the Sanqin region.

00:03:47.960 --> 00:03:48.430
But

00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:50.250
you ordered so much.

00:03:50.470 --> 00:03:51.670
Can you finish it all?

00:03:51.710 --> 00:03:52.770
It's not that much.

00:03:53.370 --> 00:03:54.829
Not that much? Seriously?

00:03:55.110 --> 00:03:56.840
That man's got more over there.

00:04:14.030 --> 00:04:14.890
Shangzhi pork.

00:04:14.930 --> 00:04:16.110
Stir-fried lotus root with meat.

00:04:16.110 --> 00:04:17.000
Steamed platter.

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:17.390
Sir,

00:04:17.839 --> 00:04:18.839
as you requested,

00:04:19.070 --> 00:04:20.160
all the dishes

00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:21.160
have been served.

00:04:21.290 --> 00:04:22.220
Enjoy your meal.

00:04:25.630 --> 00:04:27.490
Can he finish all that he ordered?

00:04:31.240 --> 00:04:31.400
[Wanfu Inn]

00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:32.850
Hope you had a great meal.
See you next time.

00:04:32.850 --> 00:04:33.510
Sure thing!

00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:34.920
Welcome, sirs.

00:04:34.920 --> 00:04:35.580
Move aside!

00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:36.430
Everyone, make way!

00:04:36.430 --> 00:04:36.800
Move!

00:04:36.830 --> 00:04:38.030
I heard Yique Yinyang

00:04:38.240 --> 00:04:38.800
and his followers

00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:39.860
are all at this inn.

00:04:39.920 --> 00:04:40.780
Where are they?

00:04:40.840 --> 00:04:41.840
Where did they go?

00:04:42.500 --> 00:04:43.000
Where?

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:43.860
Where are they?

00:04:44.510 --> 00:04:46.370
Man, I finally got a chance to eat.

00:04:47.010 --> 00:04:47.750
Don't eat it.

00:04:47.950 --> 00:04:49.280
I'll eat when I get back.

00:04:50.630 --> 00:04:51.690
Chi Yun, the Cloud.

00:04:51.730 --> 00:04:53.190
Who wants to get beaten up?

00:04:53.480 --> 00:04:54.180
Kill him!

00:04:58.750 --> 00:05:00.480
Chi Yun asked to save it for him.

00:05:00.730 --> 00:05:01.560
He'll think

00:05:01.950 --> 00:05:02.830
you ate it.

00:05:03.670 --> 00:05:05.340
Hey, Shen Langhun.

00:05:29.340 --> 00:05:30.870
They're such great delicacies.

00:05:30.870 --> 00:05:31.600
Sir, are you

00:05:31.950 --> 00:05:33.350
not satisfied with them?

00:05:33.560 --> 00:05:34.490
I don't eat much.

00:05:36.590 --> 00:05:38.250
But I wanted to try every dish.

00:05:39.070 --> 00:05:40.200
How do you like them?

00:05:41.260 --> 00:05:42.720
All these dishes are good.

00:05:43.770 --> 00:05:46.230
But I don't understand
what makes them good.

00:05:50.630 --> 00:05:52.230
Say, this gourd chicken dish

00:05:52.860 --> 00:05:54.460
is made with a whole chicken,

00:05:54.540 --> 00:05:56.470
simmered over low heat for an hour,

00:05:56.950 --> 00:05:57.480
seasoned

00:05:57.710 --> 00:05:58.310
with salt,

00:05:58.430 --> 00:05:59.460
sugar, scallions,

00:05:59.460 --> 00:06:01.240
ginger, rock sugar, and soy sauce.

00:06:01.240 --> 00:06:02.340
Then stuff Sichuan peppercorns,

00:06:02.340 --> 00:06:02.940
cinnamon,

00:06:03.280 --> 00:06:03.940
star anise,

00:06:04.280 --> 00:06:06.240
cloves, bay leaves, and other spices

00:06:06.240 --> 00:06:07.120
inside it

00:06:07.460 --> 00:06:08.720
to bring out the aroma.

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:10.070
Then deep-fry it.

00:06:10.690 --> 00:06:12.060
Just this one dish alone

00:06:12.950 --> 00:06:13.720
takes

00:06:14.090 --> 00:06:15.610
over two hours to prepare.

00:06:16.360 --> 00:06:17.090
Yet you, sir,

00:06:17.440 --> 00:06:18.900
think it's not that tasty.

00:06:19.920 --> 00:06:21.080
Making such a dish

00:06:21.990 --> 00:06:22.600
requires

00:06:22.600 --> 00:06:24.120
so much time and effort.

00:06:25.630 --> 00:06:26.430
Is it worth it?

00:06:28.440 --> 00:06:29.900
Those meaningless things

00:06:30.190 --> 00:06:31.050
are what help us

00:06:31.070 --> 00:06:33.600
make it through this limited journey
of life.

00:06:33.630 --> 00:06:34.630
Without pursuit,

00:06:35.340 --> 00:06:36.740
what joy is there in life?

00:06:36.990 --> 00:06:37.600
Likewise,

00:06:38.610 --> 00:06:39.610
without pursuit,

00:06:40.530 --> 00:06:42.190
what is there to fear in death?

00:06:43.280 --> 00:06:44.570
You are a clever man.

00:06:45.870 --> 00:06:47.130
Following this logic,

00:06:48.560 --> 00:06:49.240
if one obtains

00:06:49.240 --> 00:06:50.680
what he's been pursuing,

00:06:51.320 --> 00:06:53.250
then he should die with no regrets.

00:06:56.040 --> 00:06:56.800
Maybe.

00:06:57.920 --> 00:07:00.250
What if you chase something
to the very end

00:07:01.480 --> 00:07:03.160
only to find it's a cliff

00:07:03.970 --> 00:07:05.570
or something unattainable?

00:07:11.140 --> 00:07:13.800
Then I'll keep going for it
until I hit a dead end.

00:07:17.450 --> 00:07:18.370
I envy you

00:07:18.920 --> 00:07:20.720
for having something to pursue.

00:07:21.070 --> 00:07:22.070
I also envy you

00:07:22.920 --> 00:07:24.920
for having so much time to pursue it.

00:07:27.950 --> 00:07:29.350
It seems that delicacies

00:07:30.350 --> 00:07:31.610
are not what I'm after.

00:07:35.540 --> 00:07:36.740
How may I address you?

00:07:41.130 --> 00:07:41.990
Ghostly Peony.

00:07:44.070 --> 00:07:44.750
I am...

00:07:47.070 --> 00:07:47.720
Foxy Tang!

00:07:49.790 --> 00:07:51.450
You ate my honey-glazed ball!

00:08:03.130 --> 00:08:04.590
We shouldn't linger here.

00:08:04.960 --> 00:08:07.290
More enemies will come after us. Let's go.

00:08:12.630 --> 00:08:13.490
See you around.

00:08:15.280 --> 00:08:15.810
Goodbye,

00:08:16.680 --> 00:08:17.750
Mr. Foxy Tang.

00:08:21.460 --> 00:08:22.390
Nice to meet you.

00:08:42.789 --> 00:08:43.870
In other words,

00:08:45.290 --> 00:08:46.080
if you've done

00:08:46.080 --> 00:08:47.480
everything you should do

00:08:48.570 --> 00:08:50.970
yet still can't find
what you truly want...

00:08:55.600 --> 00:08:56.460
Check, please.

00:09:00.150 --> 00:09:00.630
Sir,

00:09:01.270 --> 00:09:03.030
there's still so much food left.

00:09:03.030 --> 00:09:03.960
What a waste.

00:09:05.390 --> 00:09:07.320
Do you have anything you want to do?

00:09:07.870 --> 00:09:10.130
Why are you suddenly asking me this, sir?

00:09:10.320 --> 00:09:10.910
I don't really

00:09:10.910 --> 00:09:12.310
have any dreams of my own.

00:09:12.510 --> 00:09:14.110
With a big family to support,

00:09:15.150 --> 00:09:15.950
making money,

00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:17.200
I mean, lots of money,

00:09:17.350 --> 00:09:18.440
is the only thing

00:09:18.440 --> 00:09:19.640
I want to do in my life.

00:09:25.870 --> 00:09:26.670
This is enough

00:09:27.500 --> 00:09:28.860
to last you a lifetime, huh?

00:09:28.860 --> 00:09:29.720
Yes, of course!

00:09:30.960 --> 00:09:31.750
I could never earn

00:09:31.750 --> 00:09:33.810
this much money, not in my whole life.

00:09:33.910 --> 00:09:34.870
Thank you, sir.

00:09:34.960 --> 00:09:36.030
Thank you for your generosity.

00:09:36.030 --> 00:09:38.090
Is there anything else you want to do?

00:09:38.090 --> 00:09:38.820
No.

00:09:39.010 --> 00:09:39.960
With this gold,

00:09:40.440 --> 00:09:41.080
I won't need

00:09:41.080 --> 00:09:43.410
to do anything else
for the rest of my life.

00:09:53.790 --> 00:09:54.850
You find him fishy?

00:09:55.660 --> 00:09:56.810
If so,

00:09:57.060 --> 00:09:58.860
why didn't you try him directly?

00:09:59.270 --> 00:10:01.390
He doesn't have the murderous intent.

00:10:01.390 --> 00:10:03.270
If trouble's coming, let it come.

00:10:03.740 --> 00:10:05.360
No need to pay special attention.

00:10:05.360 --> 00:10:06.490
I don't care anyway.

00:10:10.550 --> 00:10:11.000
Honey!

00:10:12.270 --> 00:10:12.740
Honey!

00:10:13.140 --> 00:10:13.680
Honey!

00:10:14.670 --> 00:10:15.150
Honey!

00:10:15.440 --> 00:10:15.840
Come down!

00:10:15.840 --> 00:10:16.340
Honey!

00:10:16.510 --> 00:10:17.390
Come down now!

00:10:17.550 --> 00:10:19.190
Why did you climb so high?

00:10:19.510 --> 00:10:20.870
I've achieved

00:10:20.870 --> 00:10:22.120
my lifelong goal.

00:10:22.840 --> 00:10:24.360
There's nothing left to do.

00:10:24.360 --> 00:10:25.080
Come down!

00:10:25.800 --> 00:10:26.800
Honey!

00:10:28.160 --> 00:10:30.040
Then there's no reason to live.

00:10:30.730 --> 00:10:32.960
Honey, please get down here!

00:10:32.960 --> 00:10:34.000
Honey.

00:10:35.240 --> 00:10:35.960
Honey!

00:10:39.190 --> 00:10:40.490
He's smashed into this state...

00:10:40.490 --> 00:10:41.800
Honey!

00:10:48.660 --> 00:10:50.410
[Xiuyu Peony Pavilion]

00:12:11.500 --> 00:12:12.060
Come in.

00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:25.000
Why did you act without permission?

00:12:25.170 --> 00:12:27.770
I don't want to see you
suffer anymore, Master.

00:12:28.590 --> 00:12:30.520
When did I ever say I was suffering?

00:12:38.500 --> 00:12:39.200
Master!

00:12:41.440 --> 00:12:43.700
Even if it irritates you, I must say this.

00:12:44.440 --> 00:12:45.720
Master, you used your own bloodline

00:12:45.720 --> 00:12:47.390
to forge the Thousand Curse Needle

00:12:47.390 --> 00:12:48.480
to deal with Tang Lici,

00:12:48.480 --> 00:12:49.680
but it's not worth it.

00:12:49.830 --> 00:12:50.840
Tang Lici doesn't deserve

00:12:50.840 --> 00:12:52.770
such a sacrifice from you, Master.

00:12:53.140 --> 00:12:54.780
Are you telling me what to do?

00:12:58.670 --> 00:12:59.310
Master.

00:13:07.960 --> 00:13:09.160
What brings you here?

00:13:09.880 --> 00:13:11.940
Master, treating Xiaohong this way,

00:13:12.140 --> 00:13:13.260
aren't you worried

00:13:14.600 --> 00:13:16.580
that her love might turn into hatred?

00:13:16.580 --> 00:13:17.510
Get to the point.

00:13:27.300 --> 00:13:28.360
The Leader is here.

00:13:29.120 --> 00:13:31.250
He's waiting for you at the Peony Pool.

00:13:35.350 --> 00:13:37.150
Don't always let him get his way.

00:13:52.590 --> 00:13:54.390
People only reach out for things

00:13:55.440 --> 00:13:57.640
that might slip through their fingers.

00:13:58.730 --> 00:13:59.490

as part of your game.

00:15:17.870 --> 00:15:19.510
The girl who was with Tang Lici

00:15:19.510 --> 00:15:21.060
has gone to the Sword Alliance.

00:15:21.060 --> 00:15:22.240
Does she know

00:15:22.240 --> 00:15:24.100
the location of the Fengliu Shop?

00:15:24.150 --> 00:15:25.440
The base in Sword King City

00:15:25.440 --> 00:15:27.320
is merely an expendable appendage.

00:15:27.320 --> 00:15:28.580
It's nothing serious.

00:15:30.750 --> 00:15:31.950
It took us three years

00:15:32.630 --> 00:15:34.720
to establish that waterway channel.

00:15:35.750 --> 00:15:36.750
After Tang Lici dies,

00:15:36.750 --> 00:15:39.550
there will be
countless more three-year periods.

00:15:43.430 --> 00:15:44.490

00:15:49.670 --> 00:15:50.750
I admire

your ability to recreate
the Blood Ghost Pill.

00:15:54.480 --> 00:15:56.610
You're helping the Fengliu Shop grow,

00:15:56.770 --> 00:15:58.790
and I'm having the Fengliu Shop
help you get revenge.

00:15:58.790 --> 00:15:59.920
This is reciprocal.

00:16:00.870 --> 00:16:01.870
You want revenge,

00:16:02.360 --> 00:16:03.490
and I won't stop you.

00:16:05.100 --> 00:16:07.900

00:16:23.960 --> 00:16:25.020
I know when to stop.

00:16:27.440 --> 00:16:28.840
Since you say so, Master,

00:16:29.380 --> 00:16:30.440
I can rest assured.

00:16:32.080 --> 00:16:33.610
I have news for you, Master.

00:16:34.280 --> 00:16:35.990
I saw Tang Lici in Sanqin.

00:16:37.080 --> 00:16:38.210
He was heading west.

00:16:38.790 --> 00:16:40.120
Guess where he's going?

00:16:40.730 --> 00:16:41.690
It's obvious.

00:16:42.270 --> 00:16:43.270
The Biluo Palace.

00:16:44.200 --> 00:16:45.390
But I'm curious.

00:16:45.930 --> 00:16:47.490
You met Tang Lici,

00:16:47.670 --> 00:16:49.200
yet you didn't do anything.

00:16:54.660 --> 00:16:55.990
That's your plaything.

00:16:56.130 --> 00:16:57.590
I wouldn't dare overstep.

00:16:57.630 --> 00:16:58.390
I hope you

00:16:59.070 --> 00:17:00.670
can seize this opportunity.

00:17:18.720 --> 00:17:19.180
Master.

00:17:20.750 --> 00:17:22.750
Told the East and West Palace Chiefs

00:17:23.170 --> 00:17:24.630
to catch up with Tang Lici.

00:17:25.030 --> 00:17:25.440
Yes.

00:17:32.830 --> 00:17:33.350
Master,

00:17:34.640 --> 00:17:35.640
I know my mistake.

00:18:19.100 --> 00:18:19.790
Let's go.

00:18:31.240 --> 00:18:32.040
Zhong Chunji,

00:18:32.480 --> 00:18:33.680
last time in Yanxian,

00:18:34.110 --> 00:18:35.720
you failed to bring Tang Lici to justice

00:18:35.720 --> 00:18:37.400
and made up various excuses.

00:18:38.070 --> 00:18:38.870
And this time,

00:18:39.400 --> 00:18:40.640
you had the audacity

00:18:40.640 --> 00:18:42.000
to collude with the criminal

00:18:42.000 --> 00:18:43.550
and let him get away!

00:18:43.960 --> 00:18:44.360
You...

00:18:47.030 --> 00:18:47.830
Zhong Chunji,

00:18:48.440 --> 00:18:49.510
do you even take

00:18:49.510 --> 00:18:51.240
the Sword Alliance seriously?

00:18:51.530 --> 00:18:52.340
After all,

00:18:52.830 --> 00:18:55.000
we shouldn't have
let the Yanxian incident slide.

00:18:55.000 --> 00:18:56.310
If she had arrested Tang Lici

00:18:56.310 --> 00:18:58.270
and brought him back
to the Sword Alliance in the first place,

00:18:58.270 --> 00:18:59.070
how would Sword King City

00:18:59.070 --> 00:19:00.880
have been thrown into such chaos?

00:19:00.880 --> 00:19:02.000
Although there are no casualties,

00:19:02.000 --> 00:19:03.310
Zhong Chunji, can you

00:19:03.510 --> 00:19:05.030
bear the responsibility

00:19:05.480 --> 00:19:07.740
for the cost of this city's destruction?

00:19:08.030 --> 00:19:10.160
You don't live up to the title
of the Shanfeng Branch Chief.

00:19:10.160 --> 00:19:11.400
I've said it long ago

00:19:11.790 --> 00:19:12.650
that this woman

00:19:12.960 --> 00:19:14.890
can never achieve anything great.

00:19:18.550 --> 00:19:19.400
Master Pu.

00:19:20.090 --> 00:19:21.620
What's with your attitude?

00:19:22.000 --> 00:19:24.000
The real criminal in Sword King City

00:19:24.000 --> 00:19:25.400
is Yu Qifeng, obviously.

00:19:26.240 --> 00:19:28.640
The Sword King City Case is
full of inconsistencies.

00:19:28.640 --> 00:19:30.110
The night before the public trial,

00:19:30.110 --> 00:19:31.510
Yu Qifeng set a trap,

00:19:32.000 --> 00:19:34.000
trying to frame Mr. Tang for murder.

00:19:34.350 --> 00:19:36.210
Master Puzhu can testify to this.

00:19:36.720 --> 00:19:38.520
You might as well invite him over

00:19:39.070 --> 00:19:41.160
and question him as you questioned me.

00:19:41.160 --> 00:19:41.460
You.

00:19:41.960 --> 00:19:43.680
In order to find clues
about the Evil Pill,

00:19:43.680 --> 00:19:44.310
Mr. Tang

00:19:44.310 --> 00:19:46.000
even risked going against Sword King City

00:19:46.000 --> 00:19:48.100
to collect Sword King City's past ledgers.

00:19:48.100 --> 00:19:49.630
When we were checking them,

00:19:49.680 --> 00:19:50.820
not only were there villains

00:19:50.820 --> 00:19:52.000
who destroyed the ledgers,

00:19:52.000 --> 00:19:52.830
but they also attempted to kill

00:19:52.830 --> 00:19:54.440
innocent people to silence them.

00:19:54.440 --> 00:19:54.880
Also,

00:19:55.400 --> 00:19:56.590
you said I should be responsible

00:19:56.590 --> 00:19:58.750
for the destruction of Sword King City.

00:19:58.750 --> 00:20:00.110
But when the city was destroyed,

00:20:00.110 --> 00:20:01.990
I was rescuing
and evacuating the citizens.

00:20:01.990 --> 00:20:02.590
As for you,

00:20:04.440 --> 00:20:05.160
all of you,

00:20:06.060 --> 00:20:07.190
where were you then?

00:20:11.490 --> 00:20:11.790
I...

00:20:11.790 --> 00:20:12.640
You can question me

00:20:12.640 --> 00:20:14.440
about my actions in Sword King City.

00:20:14.440 --> 00:20:15.550
I've got nothing to hide

00:20:15.550 --> 00:20:16.880
or to feel guilty about.

00:20:17.170 --> 00:20:18.300
As the Sword Master,

00:20:18.790 --> 00:20:19.960
how could you say something

00:20:19.960 --> 00:20:21.620
so narrow-minded and biased?

00:20:22.140 --> 00:20:23.070
What will people think

00:20:23.070 --> 00:20:24.030
of our Central Plains

00:20:24.030 --> 00:20:24.960
Sword Alliance?

00:20:26.640 --> 00:20:27.550
Master Pu,

00:20:28.570 --> 00:20:30.110
when have you ever
taken the Central Plains

00:20:30.110 --> 00:20:31.240
Sword Alliance seriously?

00:20:31.240 --> 00:20:32.040
Zhong Chunji!

00:20:32.240 --> 00:20:32.890
Chunji.

00:20:35.120 --> 00:20:35.960
Master Shao,

00:20:37.000 --> 00:20:38.530
forgive me for being blunt.

00:20:39.070 --> 00:20:40.030
Everyone

00:20:40.720 --> 00:20:41.160
clearly saw

00:20:41.160 --> 00:20:43.560
Tang Lici's golden eyes and forehead mark.

00:20:44.200 --> 00:20:46.240
She claims that Tang Lici is innocent.

00:20:46.240 --> 00:20:47.000
Then she should have

00:20:47.000 --> 00:20:48.810
taken Tang Lici back to clarify everything

00:20:48.810 --> 00:20:51.110
instead of letting the criminal go
in secret.

00:20:51.110 --> 00:20:52.570
If I brought Mr. Tang back,

00:20:52.810 --> 00:20:53.240
wouldn't that be

00:20:53.240 --> 00:20:55.110
playing
right into the Fengliu Shop's hands?

00:20:55.110 --> 00:20:56.220
This is just an expedient.

00:20:56.220 --> 00:20:56.790
This is just

00:20:56.790 --> 00:20:58.120
your wishful thinking.

00:20:58.790 --> 00:20:59.750
As a junior,

00:21:00.050 --> 00:21:01.270
do you think you're wiser

00:21:01.270 --> 00:21:02.800
than all the Sword Masters?

00:21:02.830 --> 00:21:04.270
Is justice in the world

00:21:05.240 --> 00:21:06.830
determined by seniority,

00:21:07.110 --> 00:21:08.030
by power,

00:21:08.410 --> 00:21:09.750
or by the number of followers?

00:21:09.750 --> 00:21:11.280
Do they represent justice?

00:21:12.030 --> 00:21:12.830
Zhong Chunji!

00:21:13.550 --> 00:21:15.640
It's one thing
that you have a lowly background,

00:21:15.640 --> 00:21:16.680
and now you even

00:21:16.680 --> 00:21:17.880
disregard the rules?

00:21:18.000 --> 00:21:18.800
Master Jiang,

00:21:19.270 --> 00:21:20.730
please stick to the point.

00:21:20.890 --> 00:21:21.510
Do you

00:21:21.840 --> 00:21:23.200
also forget the rules

00:21:23.510 --> 00:21:25.240
and want to overstep your boundaries

00:21:25.240 --> 00:21:26.110
to discipline

00:21:26.110 --> 00:21:27.510
Master Shao's disciple?

00:21:29.200 --> 00:21:30.130
I wouldn't dare.

00:21:30.790 --> 00:21:31.720
But Master Shao,

00:21:31.720 --> 00:21:32.510
as you know,

00:21:33.000 --> 00:21:34.320
people everywhere

00:21:34.420 --> 00:21:35.750
are eagerly waiting for the Sword Alliance

00:21:35.750 --> 00:21:36.790
to capture the suspect

00:21:36.790 --> 00:21:38.050
and uncover the truth.

00:21:38.270 --> 00:21:39.270
Yet Zhong Chunji,

00:21:39.480 --> 00:21:41.140
as the Shanfeng Branch Chief,

00:21:41.200 --> 00:21:42.550
has repeatedly failed in her duties

00:21:42.550 --> 00:21:43.830
and spoken disrespectfully.

00:21:43.830 --> 00:21:45.090
If we don't punish her,

00:21:45.550 --> 00:21:47.920
I'm afraid we'll have to face
public criticism.

00:21:47.920 --> 00:21:49.590
Master Jiang's got a point.

00:21:50.000 --> 00:21:51.160
I've long believed

00:21:51.920 --> 00:21:52.920
that Zhong Chunji

00:21:53.110 --> 00:21:53.920
is no longer suitable

00:21:53.920 --> 00:21:56.110
for the position
of the Shanfeng Branch Chief.

00:21:56.110 --> 00:21:58.120
We should appoint someone more capable

00:21:58.120 --> 00:21:59.750
for the good of the Sword Alliance.

00:21:59.750 --> 00:22:01.720
Otherwise, allowing such a troublemaker

00:22:01.720 --> 00:22:02.640
to act recklessly

00:22:02.640 --> 00:22:05.640
will lead others in the Sword Alliance
to follow suit.

00:22:06.240 --> 00:22:07.770
I hereby order Zhong Chunji

00:22:07.790 --> 00:22:08.510
to be immediately dismissed

00:22:08.510 --> 00:22:10.830
from her position
as the Shanfeng Branch Chief

00:22:10.830 --> 00:22:13.560
and serve
as an ordinary Sword Alliance disciple

00:22:13.880 --> 00:22:15.340
to atone for her mistakes.

00:22:16.830 --> 00:22:17.750
I object.

00:22:18.000 --> 00:22:19.440
How dare you object?

00:22:19.480 --> 00:22:21.280
Master, you've always taught me

00:22:21.400 --> 00:22:22.510
to do what is right.

00:22:24.400 --> 00:22:26.260
But I clearly did the right thing.

00:22:27.590 --> 00:22:29.310
Why am I still being blamed,

00:22:29.880 --> 00:22:30.640
punished,

00:22:31.680 --> 00:22:33.640
and bullied by all these senior masters?

00:22:33.640 --> 00:22:34.200
Chunji!

00:22:36.160 --> 00:22:37.240
Am I wrong?

00:22:38.000 --> 00:22:39.130
I don't accept this!

00:22:39.470 --> 00:22:41.370
The Sword Masters have made
their decision.

00:22:41.370 --> 00:22:42.720
You should go pack your things

00:22:42.720 --> 00:22:45.450
and move out
of the Shanfeng Branch Chief's room.

00:22:49.960 --> 00:22:50.310
Yes.

00:22:52.270 --> 00:22:53.330
I'll take my leave.

00:23:49.350 --> 00:23:50.880
What's with your attitude?

00:23:51.070 --> 00:23:52.550
Being high and mighty
just because you became

00:23:52.550 --> 00:23:54.080
the Shanfeng Branch Chief?

00:23:54.380 --> 00:23:56.490
You're actually arguing with us

00:23:56.720 --> 00:23:58.250
for an outsider, Tang Lici.

00:23:58.530 --> 00:23:59.770
I've said it long ago

00:24:00.440 --> 00:24:02.570
that people from the lower classes are

00:24:02.830 --> 00:24:04.090
always shortsighted.

00:24:05.480 --> 00:24:07.270
Give me some.

00:24:07.270 --> 00:24:07.880
Don't grab it.

00:24:07.880 --> 00:24:08.830
Give me some.

00:24:13.880 --> 00:24:15.280
I have a steamed bun left.

00:24:18.680 --> 00:24:20.680
What if we slip the beans

00:24:21.200 --> 00:24:23.200
and someone comes after us?

00:24:23.440 --> 00:24:25.040
What's there to be afraid of?

00:24:25.070 --> 00:24:26.820
Once the food is in our stomachs,

00:24:26.820 --> 00:24:27.550
they can't make us

00:24:27.550 --> 00:24:28.750
spit it out, can they?

00:24:28.960 --> 00:24:29.640
Right.

00:24:29.640 --> 00:24:30.350
Exactly.

00:24:30.350 --> 00:24:31.720
Just eat quickly.

00:24:32.200 --> 00:24:32.920
Next time,

00:24:33.240 --> 00:24:33.960
we still need you

00:24:33.960 --> 00:24:35.200
to lure the boss away.

00:24:35.310 --> 00:24:36.720
I don't want to do it again.

00:24:36.720 --> 00:24:38.110
His pinches hurt.

00:24:39.160 --> 00:24:40.960
Think about all of us.

00:24:41.310 --> 00:24:42.310
If you don't go,

00:24:42.310 --> 00:24:43.240
what will we eat?

00:24:43.680 --> 00:24:45.310
We share the weal and woe.

00:24:45.310 --> 00:24:46.030
Right.

00:24:46.030 --> 00:24:46.750
You have to go.

00:24:46.750 --> 00:24:47.550
That's right.

00:24:48.830 --> 00:24:49.270
Look!

00:24:49.480 --> 00:24:50.590
They're over there!

00:24:50.590 --> 00:24:51.090
Catch them!

00:24:51.090 --> 00:24:52.270
Don't let them escape!

00:24:52.270 --> 00:24:53.760
Mr. Tan, she did it!

00:24:53.790 --> 00:24:55.350
It has nothing to do with us!

00:24:55.960 --> 00:24:56.440
Run!

00:24:56.830 --> 00:24:57.360
Let's go!

00:24:58.720 --> 00:25:00.650
Stop right there, you little brat!

00:25:00.790 --> 00:25:01.450
Stop there!

00:25:03.730 --> 00:25:04.660
You little brat,

00:25:04.920 --> 00:25:06.320
you're quite the runner.

00:25:06.440 --> 00:25:08.170
You have nowhere to escape now!

00:25:28.790 --> 00:25:29.990
You made it out alive?

00:25:30.940 --> 00:25:32.310
Why did you betray me?

00:25:33.830 --> 00:25:34.590
Why?

00:25:34.830 --> 00:25:36.240
You're not a local here.

00:25:36.240 --> 00:25:38.270
We're already generous, giving you food.

00:25:38.270 --> 00:25:39.590
You should be grateful.

00:25:39.590 --> 00:25:40.550
That's right.

00:25:40.880 --> 00:25:42.030
Be grateful!

00:25:42.160 --> 00:25:43.640
Be grateful!

00:25:43.640 --> 00:25:44.840
You country bumpkin.

00:25:45.240 --> 00:25:46.570
You should be grateful.

00:25:49.920 --> 00:25:51.850
Since childhood, I've figured out

00:25:52.490 --> 00:25:53.850
that a homeless person

00:25:54.190 --> 00:25:56.120
is an outsider everywhere they go.

00:25:56.720 --> 00:25:59.510
People's hearts distinguish
between those close and distant.

00:25:59.510 --> 00:26:00.840
We can easily share joy,

00:26:01.310 --> 00:26:02.480
but not hardship.

00:26:04.410 --> 00:26:07.140
I thought
the Sword Alliance would be different.

00:26:07.310 --> 00:26:08.790
But despite all my efforts

00:26:08.790 --> 00:26:10.190
to be a good swordswoman,

00:26:10.400 --> 00:26:12.530
why am I criticized for my background?

00:26:12.640 --> 00:26:14.000
Why is it that when I do good deeds,

00:26:14.000 --> 00:26:15.110
I repeatedly face setbacks

00:26:15.110 --> 00:26:16.710
and even suffer innocently,

00:26:16.790 --> 00:26:18.720
while they remain high and mighty?

00:26:28.680 --> 00:26:30.740
Looks like someone is still sulking.

00:26:34.230 --> 00:26:35.760
I didn't do anything wrong.

00:26:39.750 --> 00:26:41.070
Master, you didn't answer my question

00:26:41.070 --> 00:26:42.400
at Wanhua Hall earlier.

00:26:42.920 --> 00:26:44.520
I told you to do what's right,

00:26:45.190 --> 00:26:46.270
but I never said

00:26:46.270 --> 00:26:48.270
that you wouldn't pay a price for it.

00:26:49.000 --> 00:26:50.800
Pay a price for doing good deeds?

00:26:50.830 --> 00:26:52.110
Does that even make sense?

00:26:52.110 --> 00:26:53.550
Do you think doing wrong things

00:26:53.550 --> 00:26:55.150
doesn't have consequences?

00:26:55.560 --> 00:26:56.350
When you do good deeds,

00:26:56.350 --> 00:26:57.880
even if you have to pay a price,

00:26:57.880 --> 00:26:59.610
at least you won't feel guilty.

00:27:00.240 --> 00:27:00.840
That's why

00:27:01.140 --> 00:27:02.740
it's hard to be a good person.

00:27:04.640 --> 00:27:06.310
Our Central Plains Sword Alliance

00:27:06.310 --> 00:27:07.710
does strive for justice.

00:27:08.070 --> 00:27:09.200
But as human beings,

00:27:09.590 --> 00:27:12.050
most of us
have selfish interests to pursue.

00:27:13.000 --> 00:27:15.070
The Sword Alliance is
plagued by deep-rooted problems.

00:27:15.070 --> 00:27:16.310
All the Sword Masters are

00:27:16.310 --> 00:27:18.170
strong in their own territories.

00:27:18.960 --> 00:27:20.960
But to truly make people join hands

00:27:20.960 --> 00:27:22.360
and work together as one,

00:27:22.830 --> 00:27:23.480
we need

00:27:23.480 --> 00:27:24.960
more fresh blood

00:27:25.580 --> 00:27:26.910
and decisive measures.

00:27:28.070 --> 00:27:29.470
Master, what do you mean?

00:27:31.510 --> 00:27:32.910
Alright, don't be upset.

00:27:33.590 --> 00:27:34.920
This is only temporary.

00:27:36.030 --> 00:27:36.720
I'll

00:27:36.850 --> 00:27:37.550
teach you a move,

00:27:37.550 --> 00:27:39.150
my most powerful technique.

00:27:40.000 --> 00:27:40.600
Take them.

00:27:44.920 --> 00:27:45.640
These are

00:27:46.530 --> 00:27:47.530
iron chopsticks?

00:27:47.590 --> 00:27:48.390
That's right.

00:27:48.550 --> 00:27:49.210
Throw them.

00:27:49.550 --> 00:27:50.810
Put more force into it.

00:27:53.070 --> 00:27:53.530
Well...

00:27:54.720 --> 00:27:55.380
Smash them.

00:27:55.660 --> 00:27:56.190
Go ahead.

00:27:56.780 --> 00:27:59.310
Fine, I'll throw them.
I have nothing to fear!

00:28:02.440 --> 00:28:03.030
How is it?

00:28:03.640 --> 00:28:04.440
Do you feel

00:28:04.440 --> 00:28:05.370
much better now?

00:28:05.510 --> 00:28:06.200
Smash them again.

00:28:06.200 --> 00:28:07.730
Put even more force into it.

00:28:21.110 --> 00:28:22.070
How are you feeling?

00:28:22.070 --> 00:28:23.400
Better now?

00:28:24.110 --> 00:28:24.550
This is

00:28:24.550 --> 00:28:25.920
my most powerful

00:28:26.270 --> 00:28:28.130
chopstick-throwing technique.

00:28:28.830 --> 00:28:29.640
Next time you're angry

00:28:29.640 --> 00:28:30.960
and want to smash something,

00:28:30.960 --> 00:28:32.490
just use metal chopsticks.

00:28:32.640 --> 00:28:33.720
First, they won't break.

00:28:33.720 --> 00:28:34.830
Second, they make a loud noise.

00:28:34.830 --> 00:28:35.760
Since it's loud,

00:28:35.920 --> 00:28:37.550
people will know you're angry

00:28:37.550 --> 00:28:39.280
and won't dare to mess with you.

00:28:39.510 --> 00:28:40.170
Look at you.

00:28:40.510 --> 00:28:42.970
If you break these vases
or porcelain items,

00:28:43.720 --> 00:28:45.380
it'll be such a waste of money.

00:28:45.410 --> 00:28:46.870
And if you hurt your hands,

00:28:47.270 --> 00:28:48.670
that would be even worse.

00:28:49.270 --> 00:28:50.180
These vases are nice.

00:28:50.180 --> 00:28:51.510
I'll take them as a gift.

00:28:51.790 --> 00:28:52.960
I paid for these myself.

00:28:52.960 --> 00:28:54.620
I'm taking all of them with me.

00:28:57.550 --> 00:28:58.310
Stingy.

00:29:03.830 --> 00:29:04.360
Alright,

00:29:04.680 --> 00:29:06.140
you can continue packing.

00:29:06.200 --> 00:29:07.130
I'm leaving now.

00:29:07.480 --> 00:29:08.340
Take your time.

00:29:08.880 --> 00:29:10.810
Don't forget the iron chopsticks.

00:29:22.520 --> 00:29:24.110
Have you studied the new technique

00:29:24.110 --> 00:29:25.510
that Master mentioned yesterday?

00:29:25.510 --> 00:29:26.840
I did, but I don't get it.

00:29:28.070 --> 00:29:28.670
Miss Shei.

00:29:29.510 --> 00:29:30.110
Miss Shei.

00:29:30.750 --> 00:29:31.350
Gu.

00:29:31.920 --> 00:29:32.750
Master Shao asked me to take you

00:29:32.750 --> 00:29:33.610
to get settled.

00:29:34.790 --> 00:29:35.320
This way.

00:29:37.920 --> 00:29:38.960
This is where

00:29:38.990 --> 00:29:40.960
the Shanfeng Branch disciples live.

00:29:40.960 --> 00:29:42.230
Usually, no one's here during the day.

00:29:42.230 --> 00:29:44.630
Everyone goes to practice swordsmanship.

00:29:45.070 --> 00:29:46.070
Go ahead that way,

00:29:46.240 --> 00:29:48.170
and it's your temporary quarters.

00:29:48.830 --> 00:29:50.070
If you need anything,

00:29:50.310 --> 00:29:51.310
you can come to me.

00:29:51.690 --> 00:29:52.690
Hello, Senior Gu.

00:29:53.670 --> 00:29:54.270
If you can't find me,

00:29:54.270 --> 00:29:55.930
you can ask any of them as well.

00:29:56.920 --> 00:29:57.790
Thank you, Gu.

00:29:58.110 --> 00:29:59.870
If it weren't for you and Miss Zhong,

00:29:59.870 --> 00:30:02.000
I wouldn't know what to do, where to go.

00:30:02.110 --> 00:30:03.110
Don't mention it.

00:30:03.640 --> 00:30:04.840
Before Mr. Tang left,

00:30:04.920 --> 00:30:06.030
he specifically asked me

00:30:06.030 --> 00:30:07.090
to take care of you.

00:30:07.170 --> 00:30:08.900
This is nothing.

00:30:10.230 --> 00:30:11.360
Mr. Tang...

00:30:15.440 --> 00:30:16.040
Foxy Tang.

00:30:17.830 --> 00:30:20.160
Are we really not
taking Miss Shei with us?

00:30:21.480 --> 00:30:23.440
Going to the Central Plains Sword Alliance
with Miss Zhong

00:30:23.440 --> 00:30:24.440
is a better choice

00:30:25.310 --> 00:30:26.400
for her.

00:30:45.760 --> 00:30:47.480
I spoke too harshly just now.

00:30:48.500 --> 00:30:49.030
However,

00:30:50.680 --> 00:30:51.750
I hope you remember

00:30:53.290 --> 00:30:54.200
not to mention

00:30:55.420 --> 00:30:58.370
your special constitution to anyone,
no matter what.

00:30:58.370 --> 00:30:59.680
Don't put yourself

00:31:01.310 --> 00:31:03.120
in unnecessary danger.

00:31:04.390 --> 00:31:06.050
Where are you going, Mr. Tang?

00:31:09.030 --> 00:31:10.290
Take care of yourself.

00:31:11.920 --> 00:31:13.120
Don't worry about me.

00:31:33.240 --> 00:31:33.920
Miss Shei?

00:31:36.590 --> 00:31:37.300
I'm fine.

00:31:37.790 --> 00:31:39.520
Then I'll take you to your room.

00:31:45.120 --> 00:31:45.550
Stone,

00:31:46.000 --> 00:31:46.750
stop playing.

00:31:46.750 --> 00:31:47.680
It's time to eat.

00:31:48.240 --> 00:31:49.790
Stop piling up those stupid rocks.

00:31:49.790 --> 00:31:50.440
I'm talking to you.

00:31:50.440 --> 00:31:51.500
Are you listening?

00:31:52.880 --> 00:31:53.270
Stop!

00:31:58.880 --> 00:31:59.480
Senior Gu.

00:31:59.720 --> 00:32:01.920
Were you trying to bully Xiaoshi just now?

00:32:01.920 --> 00:32:02.440
No, no.

00:32:02.540 --> 00:32:03.210
Absolutely not.

00:32:03.210 --> 00:32:04.610
Just leave the food here.

00:32:04.830 --> 00:32:05.880
Stone will eat

00:32:05.880 --> 00:32:06.960
when he wants to.

00:32:07.040 --> 00:32:07.440
Yes.

00:32:14.880 --> 00:32:16.550
Is your name Stone?

00:32:20.880 --> 00:32:21.480
Miss Shei.

00:32:23.510 --> 00:32:24.310
Stone

00:32:24.350 --> 00:32:25.680
doesn't talk to anyone.

00:32:26.510 --> 00:32:27.370
Six months ago,

00:32:27.460 --> 00:32:29.260
a master of a small sect in Lizhou

00:32:29.400 --> 00:32:31.060
suddenly went mad
along with his disciples

00:32:31.060 --> 00:32:31.550
and massacred

00:32:31.550 --> 00:32:33.010
an entire village nearby.

00:32:33.200 --> 00:32:35.140
Master Shao went to investigate in person.

00:32:35.140 --> 00:32:36.420
In a dilapidated hut there,

00:32:36.420 --> 00:32:36.920
he found

00:32:36.920 --> 00:32:38.380
Stone huddled in a corner.

00:32:38.880 --> 00:32:40.550
He must have experienced some trauma

00:32:40.550 --> 00:32:41.810
to end up in this state.

00:32:42.070 --> 00:32:42.830
Now it seems

00:32:43.000 --> 00:32:43.720
that it was

00:32:43.720 --> 00:32:45.140
the Fengliu Shop causing chaos,

00:32:45.140 --> 00:32:47.340
spreading the Blood Ghost Pills there.

00:32:47.830 --> 00:32:48.750
Master Shao

00:32:49.030 --> 00:32:50.360
is truly kind-hearted.

00:32:50.480 --> 00:32:52.070
After Stone arrived at the Sword Alliance,

00:32:52.070 --> 00:32:53.730
he's never said a single word.

00:32:54.890 --> 00:32:56.290
He's like this every day,

00:32:56.350 --> 00:32:58.010
constantly piling up stones.

00:32:58.200 --> 00:32:59.400
That's why we call him

00:33:00.200 --> 00:33:00.830
Stone.

00:33:02.200 --> 00:33:04.160
He can move such large stones?

00:33:04.720 --> 00:33:05.850
Stone's strength is

00:33:06.200 --> 00:33:08.730
much greater
than that of ordinary children.

00:33:08.790 --> 00:33:09.920
But you've also seen

00:33:10.070 --> 00:33:11.070
his personality.

00:33:17.310 --> 00:33:17.880
Stone.

00:33:38.790 --> 00:33:39.350
Stone!

00:33:39.480 --> 00:33:40.280
What's wrong?

00:33:42.510 --> 00:33:43.680
Why do I feel

00:33:44.200 --> 00:33:46.130
that he's a bit like Mr. Tang?

00:33:57.960 --> 00:33:59.590
Miss Shei, you must be joking.

00:33:59.590 --> 00:34:01.030
Mr. Tang is handsome, graceful,

00:34:01.030 --> 00:34:02.000
and eloquent.

00:34:02.350 --> 00:34:03.270
But Stone can't even

00:34:03.270 --> 00:34:04.200
speak properly.

00:34:04.510 --> 00:34:05.440
I don't know why.

00:34:06.200 --> 00:34:07.680
It's just a feeling.

00:34:10.360 --> 00:34:10.960
Miss Shei,

00:34:11.510 --> 00:34:13.310
let me take you to your quarters.

00:34:33.320 --> 00:34:34.110
You two!

00:34:34.670 --> 00:34:35.630
I'm dog-tired.

00:34:37.440 --> 00:34:38.570
You're still eating

00:34:38.800 --> 00:34:40.000
as if watching a show?

00:34:40.320 --> 00:34:41.630
If I go fight, they'll end up

00:34:41.630 --> 00:34:43.290
either dead or badly injured.

00:34:44.400 --> 00:34:45.190
I'm injured.

00:34:47.320 --> 00:34:48.580
How are your injuries?

00:34:49.409 --> 00:34:50.210
Not fatal.

00:34:50.840 --> 00:34:52.500
But when it comes to fighting,

00:34:52.710 --> 00:34:53.920
I should avoid it if possible.

00:34:53.920 --> 00:34:55.550
So you're just making me do all the work.

00:34:55.550 --> 00:34:57.050
You are my bodyguard after all.

00:34:57.050 --> 00:34:58.510
Even an ox

00:34:58.510 --> 00:35:00.190
needs some rest when plowing.

00:35:00.920 --> 00:35:01.630
This is already

00:35:01.630 --> 00:35:03.190
the third batch today.

00:35:03.630 --> 00:35:05.080
If we keep attracting attention like this,

00:35:05.080 --> 00:35:05.920
fighting our way through

00:35:05.920 --> 00:35:07.000
is not a good idea.

00:35:07.710 --> 00:35:09.330
The whole world is looking for us.

00:35:09.330 --> 00:35:11.190
Hiding anywhere ends up the same.

00:35:11.480 --> 00:35:13.630
These ordinary martial artists are
no big problem.

00:35:13.630 --> 00:35:15.400
But if we keep getting delayed like this,

00:35:15.400 --> 00:35:17.590
the Fengliu Shop
will catch up with us sooner or later.

00:35:17.590 --> 00:35:18.650
Especially Liu Yan

00:35:18.920 --> 00:35:19.810
and the other one...

00:35:19.810 --> 00:35:21.540
That Xifang Tao you mentioned.

00:35:22.800 --> 00:35:25.060
West Peach (Xifang Tao) of three colors.

00:35:25.710 --> 00:35:26.640
She's powerful.

00:35:27.370 --> 00:35:29.170
She's got great inner strength.

00:35:29.230 --> 00:35:29.760
However,

00:35:31.030 --> 00:35:31.960
that's nothing.

00:35:33.070 --> 00:35:33.710
She's

00:35:34.510 --> 00:35:36.710
so good at waiting for the right timing.

00:35:37.940 --> 00:35:39.530
Her stab to my abdomen

00:35:40.070 --> 00:35:41.730
nearly severed my meridians.

00:35:42.530 --> 00:35:44.380
She's a well-disguised snake.

00:35:44.960 --> 00:35:45.510
The Fengliu Shop

00:35:45.510 --> 00:35:47.970
won't give you a chance
to catch your breath.

00:35:48.020 --> 00:35:49.270
Bait like me is

00:35:50.230 --> 00:35:52.110
worth them coming out in full force.

00:35:52.110 --> 00:35:53.670
Who knows what you're

00:35:53.670 --> 00:35:54.880
planning, Foxy Tang?

00:35:55.500 --> 00:35:56.700
What should we do now?

00:35:57.030 --> 00:35:58.480
Still follow your map?

00:35:59.450 --> 00:36:00.580
Mr. Zhao, Mr. Zhang.

00:36:01.320 --> 00:36:02.050
Hi, Mr. Wang.

00:36:02.150 --> 00:36:03.080
Long time no see.

00:36:03.890 --> 00:36:04.490
This time,

00:36:04.650 --> 00:36:06.920
we must arrest him
and bring him to justice.

00:36:06.920 --> 00:36:08.710
More people are coming after us.

00:36:08.710 --> 00:36:09.770
Let's leave first.

00:36:20.400 --> 00:36:21.320
Miss Shei,

00:36:21.920 --> 00:36:23.000
please have some tea.

00:36:23.000 --> 00:36:24.200
So what's the matter?

00:36:24.880 --> 00:36:26.070
I was with them

00:36:26.800 --> 00:36:29.060
through the entire Sword King City Case.

00:36:29.280 --> 00:36:30.800
Mr. Tang was indeed

00:36:31.030 --> 00:36:33.480
investigating the truth
about the Blood Ghost Pill

00:36:33.480 --> 00:36:34.630
when he was framed.

00:36:36.360 --> 00:36:37.760
Do you have any evidence?

00:36:40.440 --> 00:36:42.070
Mr. Tang and Miss Zhong

00:36:42.360 --> 00:36:44.400
found the ledgers of Sword King City.

00:36:44.400 --> 00:36:45.230
I

00:36:45.480 --> 00:36:47.610
noted down all the suspicious details

00:36:47.920 --> 00:36:49.580
for your review, Master Shao.

00:36:51.480 --> 00:36:53.640
Weren't the ledgers burned?

00:36:54.510 --> 00:36:57.070
Although those ledgers revealing clues

00:36:57.510 --> 00:36:58.910
have all been destroyed,

00:36:59.440 --> 00:37:00.590
I still remember

00:37:01.000 --> 00:37:03.000
the suspicious locations we found.

00:37:03.400 --> 00:37:05.110
So I sorted through and memorized them,

00:37:05.110 --> 00:37:06.150
all written down in this notebook.

00:37:06.150 --> 00:37:07.810
You have an excellent memory.

00:37:08.160 --> 00:37:10.960
Someone has been sent
to investigate this matter.

00:37:10.980 --> 00:37:12.020
Miss Shei,

00:37:12.300 --> 00:37:14.140
could you take a walk with me?

00:37:23.460 --> 00:37:24.500
Miss Shei.

00:37:25.000 --> 00:37:27.250
It might sound a bit blunt,

00:37:28.670 --> 00:37:30.570
but I've been wanting to ask you this.

00:37:30.570 --> 00:37:31.320
Since you are

00:37:31.320 --> 00:37:33.450
a survivor of the Hao family massacre,

00:37:33.800 --> 00:37:35.030
why did you keep following someone

00:37:35.030 --> 00:37:36.800
who's suspected of being the murderer?

00:37:36.800 --> 00:37:37.760
Although

00:37:37.760 --> 00:37:38.800
he does look like

00:37:38.800 --> 00:37:40.460
that black-clad pipa player,

00:37:41.050 --> 00:37:42.300
after meeting him,

00:37:42.550 --> 00:37:43.400
I had a feeling

00:37:44.030 --> 00:37:45.490
that he's not that person.

00:37:46.790 --> 00:37:49.050
Mr. Tang not only found the real culprit,

00:37:49.140 --> 00:37:50.460
but also took me in.

00:37:51.340 --> 00:37:53.110
After my time with him,

00:37:54.150 --> 00:37:55.430
I feel

00:37:56.240 --> 00:37:58.370
that he doesn't want to be a bad person.

00:37:58.370 --> 00:38:00.520
Not that he's a good person,

00:38:00.890 --> 00:38:01.440
but

00:38:01.440 --> 00:38:03.370
that he doesn't want to be a bad one?

00:38:03.520 --> 00:38:05.520
That's an interesting way to put it.

00:38:05.810 --> 00:38:06.670
Don't you resent him

00:38:06.670 --> 00:38:08.510
for dragging you into danger?

00:38:09.230 --> 00:38:10.480
He made someone

00:38:10.820 --> 00:38:12.190
who should have

00:38:12.190 --> 00:38:13.400
seen him as an enemy

00:38:13.880 --> 00:38:15.480
not only stop hating him,

00:38:15.710 --> 00:38:17.300
but also want to brave danger for him.

00:38:17.300 --> 00:38:18.530
Doesn't this prove

00:38:18.730 --> 00:38:20.520
that Mr. Tang is trustworthy?

00:38:22.920 --> 00:38:23.630
Well, then,

00:38:24.110 --> 00:38:25.070
I

00:38:25.780 --> 00:38:28.180
would like to ask you for a favor,
Miss Shei.

00:38:39.320 --> 00:38:40.480
The people chasing us now

00:38:40.480 --> 00:38:41.760
use peculiar techniques.

00:38:41.760 --> 00:38:43.690
They must be from the Fengliu Shop.

00:38:44.320 --> 00:38:45.580
They're finally here.

00:38:45.920 --> 00:38:47.070
So you deliberately lingered here

00:38:47.070 --> 00:38:48.070
waiting for them.

00:38:53.900 --> 00:38:54.900
We'll talk later.

00:39:05.030 --> 00:39:05.710
Chi Yun,

00:39:06.480 --> 00:39:07.280
are you here?

00:39:11.670 --> 00:39:12.360
Chi Yun?

00:39:30.230 --> 00:39:31.760
She even sent a signal?

00:39:32.360 --> 00:39:34.190
She really has no regard for our past.

00:39:34.190 --> 00:39:34.840
It seems

00:39:35.340 --> 00:39:36.590
that Miss Bai doesn't want

00:39:36.590 --> 00:39:38.320
to have anything to do with you.

00:39:39.320 --> 00:39:40.650
But she's still my wife.

00:39:40.960 --> 00:39:42.960
You should learn to respect others.

00:39:43.000 --> 00:39:44.600
How have I disrespected her?

00:39:53.630 --> 00:39:55.480
Greetings, East Palace Chief,

00:39:55.480 --> 00:39:56.540
West Palace Chief.

00:39:58.280 --> 00:39:59.340
Where is Tang Lici?

00:40:00.150 --> 00:40:01.680
I tracked him to this place,

00:40:02.000 --> 00:40:02.840
but somehow

00:40:03.000 --> 00:40:04.200
I lost his trail here.

00:40:05.150 --> 00:40:06.550
Seems like Mr. Tang isn't

00:40:06.720 --> 00:40:08.250
good at hiding or escaping.

00:40:10.360 --> 00:40:12.190
So why did you send that damn signal?

00:40:12.190 --> 00:40:13.920
You're scaring off our target!

00:40:21.950 --> 00:40:22.620
Fucui,

00:40:23.480 --> 00:40:25.410
do not hit women to vent your anger.

00:40:35.000 --> 00:40:36.490
You're my subordinate,

00:40:36.880 --> 00:40:38.730
yet you can't even handle
such a simple task.

00:40:38.730 --> 00:40:40.200
Next time I assign you something

00:40:40.200 --> 00:40:41.260
and you fail again,

00:40:41.590 --> 00:40:43.230
I'll tear you apart!

00:40:43.800 --> 00:40:44.230
Yes.

00:40:45.110 --> 00:40:46.630
There are only two routes

00:40:46.920 --> 00:40:48.920
to the Biluo Palace, west and south.

00:40:49.150 --> 00:40:50.610
If we take the south route,

00:40:50.670 --> 00:40:52.870
we'll definitely intercept Tang Lici.

00:40:53.000 --> 00:40:54.460
What about the west route?

00:40:54.490 --> 00:40:55.690
No one can go that way.

00:40:57.880 --> 00:40:58.410
Let's go!

00:41:17.800 --> 00:41:19.860
Apply this, and it will heal quickly.

00:41:20.230 --> 00:41:21.890
Thank you, West Palace Chief.

00:41:22.110 --> 00:41:23.110
We're both women.

00:41:24.510 --> 00:41:25.920
Let's look after each other.

00:41:25.920 --> 00:41:26.850
I wouldn't dare.

00:41:34.360 --> 00:41:35.760
He even dared to hit my...

00:41:37.310 --> 00:41:38.510
Dared to hit Miss Bai.

00:41:38.550 --> 00:41:39.510
He'd better not let me catch him.

00:41:39.510 --> 00:41:41.110
I'll beat him to death if I do.

00:41:41.110 --> 00:41:41.840
Don't worry.

00:41:42.280 --> 00:41:42.840
You'll

00:41:44.590 --> 00:41:46.280
definitely meet that person again.

00:41:46.280 --> 00:41:46.920
Next time,

00:41:48.150 --> 00:41:50.150
let him pay the price with interest.

00:42:03.820 --> 00:42:05.620
Where did this pigeon come from?

00:42:11.690 --> 00:42:12.820
We're on the run now.

00:42:13.000 --> 00:42:14.260
Who are you writing to?

00:42:14.440 --> 00:42:15.510
Master Puzhu.

00:42:46.350 --> 00:42:48.140
[Jingnan]

00:42:49.800 --> 00:42:50.480
Sir,

00:42:50.840 --> 00:42:51.920
we found 50 boxes of Evil Pills

00:42:51.920 --> 00:42:53.380
from the ships at the dock.

00:42:53.480 --> 00:42:54.140
The next one

00:42:54.840 --> 00:42:55.970
is the Jingnan Sect.

00:42:56.210 --> 00:42:57.010
I'll go first.

00:42:57.710 --> 00:42:58.310
Follow me.

00:42:58.320 --> 00:42:58.760
Yes.

00:43:03.800 --> 00:43:05.190
Are you two

00:43:05.190 --> 00:43:06.450
on such good terms now?

00:43:06.830 --> 00:43:08.030
What's going on here?

00:43:09.670 --> 00:43:10.590
He's been looking for

00:43:10.590 --> 00:43:12.360
the Fengliu Shop's hideouts along the way.

00:43:12.360 --> 00:43:13.560
When did this happen?

00:43:14.030 --> 00:43:15.230
While you were asleep,

00:43:15.230 --> 00:43:17.030
I asked Shen to help me investigate.

00:43:17.030 --> 00:43:18.760
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

00:43:19.370 --> 00:43:21.440
So you deliberately
exposed your whereabouts

00:43:21.440 --> 00:43:22.240
just for this?

00:43:22.290 --> 00:43:23.770
After Shei reached the Sword Alliance,

00:43:23.770 --> 00:43:24.510
she'd surely reveal

00:43:24.510 --> 00:43:25.910
the clues we discovered.

00:43:26.240 --> 00:43:27.990
And the Sword Alliance would definitely
use this information

00:43:27.990 --> 00:43:30.120
to investigate Fengliu Shop's bases.

00:43:30.510 --> 00:43:31.770
By exposing my whereabouts

00:43:31.770 --> 00:43:33.920
to attract the main forces
of the Fengliu Shop,

00:43:33.920 --> 00:43:35.070
we could prevent casualties

00:43:35.070 --> 00:43:36.630
of the Sword Alliance as much as possible.

00:43:36.630 --> 00:43:38.360
Shen helps me investigate

00:43:38.360 --> 00:43:40.110
the Fengliu Shop's remaining hideouts
along the way.

00:43:40.110 --> 00:43:41.150
This way, we can help

00:43:41.150 --> 00:43:44.380
the Sword Alliance eliminate
more of the Fengliu Shop's forces.

00:43:44.380 --> 00:43:45.710
There's one more thing.

00:43:46.030 --> 00:43:46.400
What?

00:43:47.110 --> 00:43:48.710
Hurrying to the Biluo Palace too soon

00:43:48.710 --> 00:43:49.510
is pointless.

00:43:59.070 --> 00:44:01.070
Are we really going to the Biluo Palace?

00:44:01.070 --> 00:44:01.670
Looks like

00:44:02.030 --> 00:44:03.590
the reputation of Biluo Palace

00:44:03.590 --> 00:44:04.550
precedes it.

00:44:04.890 --> 00:44:06.650
That's the most mysterious place,

00:44:06.650 --> 00:44:08.510
even exceeding the Shisan Tower.

00:44:12.480 --> 00:44:14.180
No one has ever been to the Biluo Palace.

00:44:14.180 --> 00:44:14.880
Or rather,

00:44:15.320 --> 00:44:16.190
no one has ever gotten

00:44:16.190 --> 00:44:17.250
out of there alive.

00:44:17.920 --> 00:44:18.510
Everyone knows

00:44:18.510 --> 00:44:20.170
it's in the northwest region,

00:44:20.320 --> 00:44:22.320
but no one knows its exact location.

00:44:22.320 --> 00:44:22.850
Catch it.

00:44:27.030 --> 00:44:28.200
Someone has been there

00:44:28.200 --> 00:44:28.800
and

00:44:30.220 --> 00:44:31.350
made it out alive.
