[Sword and Beloved]

00:01:46.750 --> 00:01:50.479
[Episode 15]

00:01:59.950 --> 00:02:00.760
Cousin.

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:06.310
I won't let you die so easily.

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:33.750
Young Master Fugui,

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:34.710
dinner's ready.

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:35.280
Mm.

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:39.750
You've come all this way.

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:41.280
Aren't you going to come in?

00:02:44.710 --> 00:02:45.800
Young Master Rumu?

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:50.280
I rushed here

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:51.740
as soon as I heard the news.

00:02:52.630 --> 00:02:54.890
I thought you'd be in some pitiful state—

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:56.460
but I didn't expect

00:02:56.910 --> 00:02:58.030
your life here

00:02:58.630 --> 00:03:01.030
to be much better
than at the Wangquan Manor.

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:02.310
You're really something.

00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:03.520
Nothing can stump you.

00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:05.720
Even when I hide here, you still find me.

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:07.150
After all, I'm

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:08.680
your only friend, aren't I?

00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:11.580
Young Master Rumu,

00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:13.920
I'll get another set of tableware for you.

00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:30.910
Fugui,

00:03:31.910 --> 00:03:33.120
this wine's no good.

00:03:33.520 --> 00:03:34.650
Where did you buy it?

00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:36.840
Forget it.

00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:39.410
You don't drink anyway. Can't blame you.

00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:42.150
Fugui,

00:03:42.960 --> 00:03:44.079
how old are you now?

00:03:44.590 --> 00:03:46.250
Still carving a wooden sword?

00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:53.360
Fugui,

00:03:53.870 --> 00:03:54.840
there's something

00:03:54.840 --> 00:03:56.170
I've never figured out.

00:03:56.590 --> 00:03:57.590
Tell me the truth.

00:03:58.910 --> 00:04:00.520
Who drove you to this point?

00:04:06.590 --> 00:04:07.520
Don't tell me...

00:04:09.150 --> 00:04:10.080
it was my father.

00:04:35.610 --> 00:04:36.240
I'm fine.

00:04:36.790 --> 00:04:38.120
It's just an old injury.

00:04:40.990 --> 00:04:41.600
Fugui,

00:04:42.070 --> 00:04:43.240
I'm really fine.

00:04:44.630 --> 00:04:45.680
I've made it this far,

00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:47.550
and every time, I've managed to
survive against all odds.

00:04:47.550 --> 00:04:48.480
You...

00:04:49.800 --> 00:04:51.600
You don't need to worry about me.

00:04:52.830 --> 00:04:53.620
Why?

00:04:55.360 --> 00:04:56.670
What do you mean, "why"?

00:04:56.670 --> 00:04:58.780
All your meridians have been destroyed.

00:04:58.780 --> 00:05:00.580
It obviously happened long ago.

00:05:00.870 --> 00:05:01.750
Who hurt you?

00:05:04.090 --> 00:05:04.720
Fugui,

00:05:05.240 --> 00:05:06.370
you're the Soldier.

00:05:06.600 --> 00:05:07.560
Calm down.

00:05:07.950 --> 00:05:09.040
I'm asking you—

00:05:09.750 --> 00:05:10.830
who did this to you?

00:05:14.150 --> 00:05:14.710
Fugui,

00:05:15.560 --> 00:05:16.720
before I answer,

00:05:17.200 --> 00:05:18.560
let me tell you a story.

00:05:19.560 --> 00:05:21.240
I haven't finished telling you the story

00:05:21.240 --> 00:05:22.440
of me and Long Weiyun.

00:05:22.980 --> 00:05:24.410
If you don't listen now,

00:05:24.960 --> 00:05:25.830
you may not

00:05:26.360 --> 00:05:27.720
get the chance again.

00:05:29.310 --> 00:05:30.240
As you know,

00:05:30.830 --> 00:05:32.700
after my father went to
the Western Regions,

00:05:32.700 --> 00:05:34.500
he killed a lot of dragon demons.

00:05:35.510 --> 00:05:36.909
But what you don't know is

00:05:37.700 --> 00:05:40.230
that he also toyed with
a dragon demon's heart

00:05:40.540 --> 00:05:42.000
and tortured her to death.

00:05:45.600 --> 00:05:46.240
Later,

00:05:46.560 --> 00:05:48.960
that dragon demon's daughter abducted me,

00:05:49.520 --> 00:05:52.250
wanting to exchange me
for her mother's remains.

00:05:54.070 --> 00:05:55.040
But my father...

00:05:56.250 --> 00:05:58.600
he didn't care about my life at all.

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:01.750
So...

00:06:03.050 --> 00:06:04.390
her plan failed.

00:06:08.110 --> 00:06:09.720
Sister, help me.

00:06:11.120 --> 00:06:12.040
Help me...

00:06:16.090 --> 00:06:17.000
Help me...

00:06:17.600 --> 00:06:18.600
Stop pretending.

00:06:19.160 --> 00:06:21.120
Your own father doesn't care about you.

00:06:21.120 --> 00:06:22.430
You think I would?

00:06:37.360 --> 00:06:38.720
Help me...

00:06:41.310 --> 00:06:43.840
Dragon demons are born
with the power to heal.

00:06:44.730 --> 00:06:45.830
Funny enough,

00:06:46.510 --> 00:06:47.750
my family couldn't help me

00:06:47.750 --> 00:06:48.870
with my asthma,

00:06:49.610 --> 00:06:51.409
but my family's enemy healed me.

00:06:52.080 --> 00:06:53.870
After she cured my asthma,

00:06:54.360 --> 00:06:55.620
she wanted to let me go.

00:06:56.010 --> 00:06:57.470
But I, an abandoned child,

00:06:57.610 --> 00:06:59.790
didn't want to return to that cold family,

00:06:59.790 --> 00:07:01.560
so I shamelessly followed her.

00:07:03.160 --> 00:07:04.070
And I stayed

00:07:04.720 --> 00:07:05.920
for over 10 years.

00:07:08.330 --> 00:07:11.060
She's cold on the outside,
yet warm on the inside.

00:07:11.320 --> 00:07:12.780
No wonder you've never had

00:07:13.390 --> 00:07:15.120
any prejudice against demons.

00:07:15.430 --> 00:07:16.830
You mentioned it before.

00:07:17.720 --> 00:07:19.310
Turns out you comprehended

00:07:19.720 --> 00:07:21.850
your own Way of the Sword in the desert.

00:07:23.480 --> 00:07:24.540
At that time,

00:07:24.720 --> 00:07:26.870
after I comprehended
my own Way of the Sword,

00:07:26.870 --> 00:07:28.600
the first thing I did for her...

00:07:29.560 --> 00:07:30.800
was to return home

00:07:30.920 --> 00:07:32.920
and retrieve her mother's remains.

00:07:34.480 --> 00:07:36.310
Don't you want to know

00:07:36.310 --> 00:07:38.310
where I've been these past few days?

00:07:38.600 --> 00:07:40.460
Can you hold back from telling me?

00:07:42.680 --> 00:07:44.950
I just went home,

00:07:45.310 --> 00:07:47.510
stealing and forcing my way through...

00:07:48.680 --> 00:07:49.870
to get...

00:07:50.720 --> 00:07:51.650
what you wanted.

00:07:53.830 --> 00:07:55.630
All that's left of your mother's remains

00:07:55.630 --> 00:07:57.000
is her skull.

00:08:15.910 --> 00:08:18.520
[Dragon Cave]

00:08:27.970 --> 00:08:28.600
Mother,

00:08:29.430 --> 00:08:31.430
you're finally able to return home.

00:08:31.720 --> 00:08:33.270
Rest in peace

00:08:33.870 --> 00:08:35.000
in the Dragon Cave.

00:08:57.770 --> 00:08:58.690
What is this?

00:09:12.300 --> 00:09:16.230
[Long Weiyun's Mother]

00:09:20.080 --> 00:09:21.790
I scraped off your dragon scales

00:09:21.790 --> 00:09:23.720
and absorbed them into my own body.

00:09:24.820 --> 00:09:25.490
Look.

00:09:26.320 --> 00:09:27.400
My left arm is now

00:09:28.520 --> 00:09:30.590
impervious to all weapons.

00:09:33.390 --> 00:09:35.920
Unfortunately, your scales can't
grow back.

00:09:37.200 --> 00:09:38.440
But I heard that...

00:09:41.990 --> 00:09:43.720
dragon horns...

00:09:47.360 --> 00:09:49.390
can regrow when cut off.

00:10:14.790 --> 00:10:17.450
That's Mother's memory
from when she was alive.

00:10:17.570 --> 00:10:18.620
Quan Jingting,

00:10:19.360 --> 00:10:20.750
you bastard.

00:10:21.840 --> 00:10:23.200
Poor child,

00:10:23.360 --> 00:10:24.510
you've suffered.

00:10:32.210 --> 00:10:32.940
Who are you?

00:10:33.460 --> 00:10:34.730
I'm the last dragon spirit

00:10:34.730 --> 00:10:36.850
with memories in the Dragon Cave.

00:10:37.410 --> 00:10:38.830
I've been waiting for you here

00:10:38.830 --> 00:10:40.510
for many years,

00:10:41.110 --> 00:10:43.870
just to give this Water-Control Orb
to you.

00:10:45.480 --> 00:10:46.630
Water-Control Orb?

00:10:48.630 --> 00:10:50.760
I've been searching for it for so long,

00:10:51.440 --> 00:10:53.360
and it was actually here all along?

00:10:53.360 --> 00:10:56.420
It was entrusted to me by your mother
when she was alive.

00:10:56.670 --> 00:10:58.870
She told me not to give it to you

00:10:59.130 --> 00:11:00.860
unless absolutely necessary.

00:11:01.390 --> 00:11:03.000
But I died long ago,
and my spirit is weak.

00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:04.660
I may dissipate at any moment.

00:11:05.270 --> 00:11:06.080
Now

00:11:06.480 --> 00:11:09.150
you're the last True Dragon of our clan.

00:11:09.710 --> 00:11:11.310
This sacred relic of our clan

00:11:11.390 --> 00:11:13.000
should be kept by you.

00:11:13.600 --> 00:11:14.240
Remember,

00:11:14.790 --> 00:11:17.390
though this Water-Control Orb
holds immense power,

00:11:17.390 --> 00:11:19.510
until you have the strength to control it,

00:11:19.510 --> 00:11:21.370
treasure your own life above all.

00:11:21.630 --> 00:11:23.390
I only learned much later...

00:11:25.080 --> 00:11:27.280
Weiyun's heart burned with vengeance,

00:11:27.390 --> 00:11:28.120
so

00:11:28.240 --> 00:11:31.190
she chose to forcefully absorb
that Water-Control Orb

00:11:31.190 --> 00:11:32.990
to obtain the True Dragon Power.

00:11:33.640 --> 00:11:34.720
The Water-Control Orb is

00:11:34.720 --> 00:11:36.850
the greatest treasure
of the True Dragon Clan.

00:11:36.850 --> 00:11:39.910
It can naturally absorb
all demon power for its own use.

00:11:40.240 --> 00:11:41.280
Since ancient times,

00:11:41.280 --> 00:11:43.880
this orb has absorbed
countless demon powers,

00:11:44.030 --> 00:11:45.510
making it very unstable.

00:11:45.580 --> 00:11:47.110
It's a double-edged sword.

00:11:47.390 --> 00:11:49.720
To control it is
to command rain and storm;

00:11:50.030 --> 00:11:51.230
to be controlled by it

00:11:51.750 --> 00:11:53.680
is to fall into madness overnight.

00:12:07.060 --> 00:12:08.120
I can't believe...

00:12:08.870 --> 00:12:10.550
I failed to absorb it.

00:12:11.790 --> 00:12:13.120
Ever since she found out

00:12:13.150 --> 00:12:15.410
in the Dragon Cave what my father had done

00:12:16.180 --> 00:12:17.390
to her mother,

00:12:18.360 --> 00:12:19.150
Long Weiyun

00:12:19.620 --> 00:12:21.020
hated me to the very core.

00:12:22.560 --> 00:12:23.870
But I had no idea.

00:12:25.920 --> 00:12:27.030
Until one day,

00:12:27.550 --> 00:12:29.410
she suddenly asked me a question.

00:12:29.910 --> 00:12:30.970
What kind of person

00:12:32.110 --> 00:12:33.640
do you think your father is?

00:12:35.360 --> 00:12:36.390
How should I...

00:12:37.960 --> 00:12:39.360
answer that?

00:12:41.450 --> 00:12:43.580
After all, he is my biological father.

00:12:45.310 --> 00:12:46.140
Yes.

00:12:53.750 --> 00:12:54.670
Do you like me?

00:12:56.960 --> 00:12:57.510
What?

00:12:59.260 --> 00:13:00.180
You... You...

00:13:00.940 --> 00:13:02.180
You... I... I...

00:13:04.530 --> 00:13:05.290
Weiyun...

00:13:05.650 --> 00:13:07.050
I'll take you somewhere.

00:13:14.780 --> 00:13:15.200
[Dragon Clan's Habitat]

00:13:15.200 --> 00:13:16.320
There's such a beautiful place

00:13:16.320 --> 00:13:17.600
in this desert.

00:13:18.600 --> 00:13:20.060
I've never seen it before.

00:13:20.120 --> 00:13:22.190
Do you know what this place used to be?

00:13:25.730 --> 00:13:26.870
Was it a place

00:13:26.870 --> 00:13:28.200
as beautiful as you are?

00:13:30.460 --> 00:13:32.720
This was once our dragon clan's habitat.

00:13:33.300 --> 00:13:34.630
Thousands of years ago,

00:13:35.570 --> 00:13:39.060
this desert was once an oasis,
with clear skies and blue waters.

00:13:39.060 --> 00:13:39.690
Later,

00:13:40.850 --> 00:13:42.580
the oasis turned into a desert,

00:13:42.960 --> 00:13:44.220
and our clan declined.

00:13:44.770 --> 00:13:46.630
So our dragon demons became rare.

00:13:47.530 --> 00:13:49.930
But our dragon clan
has always had a custom.

00:13:51.270 --> 00:13:54.200
We bring the person we love,
who loves us in return...

00:13:54.940 --> 00:13:55.910
to this place.

00:14:02.330 --> 00:14:03.790
You haven't answered the question

00:14:03.790 --> 00:14:05.080
I asked you at home.

00:14:07.190 --> 00:14:08.360
Do you like me?

00:14:12.840 --> 00:14:13.750
I-I do.

00:14:15.200 --> 00:14:16.200
I like you.

00:14:22.520 --> 00:14:23.920
What do you like about me?

00:14:26.650 --> 00:14:29.450
I like the way you look
when you're lost in thought.

00:14:29.900 --> 00:14:30.870
I like how you

00:14:31.080 --> 00:14:32.340
have a cold expression

00:14:32.790 --> 00:14:34.200
but a soft heart.

00:14:35.360 --> 00:14:37.090
I like following behind you...

00:14:38.080 --> 00:14:39.250
watching your back.

00:14:42.200 --> 00:14:42.910
Anyway...

00:14:43.550 --> 00:14:45.120
I like everything about you.

00:14:45.120 --> 00:14:45.910
So much that

00:14:46.150 --> 00:14:47.000
I'd do

00:14:47.290 --> 00:14:48.510
anything for you.

00:14:59.840 --> 00:15:00.640
I remember...

00:15:02.190 --> 00:15:03.600
today is your birthday.

00:15:05.390 --> 00:15:06.720
You even remember that?

00:15:07.720 --> 00:15:09.180
How about I give you a gift?

00:15:09.480 --> 00:15:10.120
Great!

00:15:11.120 --> 00:15:11.920
Wait, Weiyun.

00:15:12.670 --> 00:15:14.070
I also have a gift for you.

00:15:15.270 --> 00:15:15.840
Look.

00:15:16.280 --> 00:15:17.270
I searched for this flagon

00:15:17.270 --> 00:15:18.130
for a long time.

00:15:19.270 --> 00:15:20.270
I just hope...

00:15:21.390 --> 00:15:23.320
every time you drink in the future,

00:15:23.720 --> 00:15:24.910
you'll think of me.

00:15:28.030 --> 00:15:28.510
Okay.

00:15:31.030 --> 00:15:31.490
Weiyun,

00:15:31.630 --> 00:15:32.490
it's your turn.

00:15:33.360 --> 00:15:34.620
Should I close my eyes?

00:15:48.150 --> 00:15:49.030
Wow...

00:15:52.240 --> 00:15:53.300
It's so beautiful.

00:15:57.790 --> 00:15:58.960
So beautiful.

00:16:09.200 --> 00:16:09.840
Weiyun.

00:16:10.840 --> 00:16:11.720
Can you...

00:16:12.330 --> 00:16:13.530
promise me one thing?

00:16:14.590 --> 00:16:15.240
Go ahead.

00:16:16.200 --> 00:16:18.330
From now on, every year on my birthday,

00:16:19.480 --> 00:16:21.010
will you make it snow for me?

00:16:24.910 --> 00:16:25.320
Mm.

00:16:27.720 --> 00:16:28.120
Okay.

00:16:50.310 --> 00:16:52.170
Our dragon clan has now declined,

00:16:52.520 --> 00:16:53.240
so

00:16:53.550 --> 00:16:55.550
if you encounter
any difficulties absorbing

00:16:55.550 --> 00:16:56.880
the Water-Control Orb,

00:16:56.910 --> 00:16:58.360
you can use this.

00:16:58.790 --> 00:17:01.790
Never forcefully absorb it,
or you'll lose your life.

00:17:03.150 --> 00:17:05.270
This is the Love Gu
of the Southern Border.

00:17:05.270 --> 00:17:07.550
It can only be planted on someone

00:17:07.550 --> 00:17:09.109
who has deep feelings for you

00:17:09.109 --> 00:17:11.109
and is devoted to you heart and soul.

00:17:11.510 --> 00:17:12.589
From then on,

00:17:12.829 --> 00:17:15.200
they will bear all the pain for you

00:17:15.349 --> 00:17:16.790
and be controlled by you.

00:17:42.770 --> 00:17:43.480
That day,

00:17:43.850 --> 00:17:45.400
she planted the Love Gu on me,

00:17:45.400 --> 00:17:46.440
wanting me to take on the pain

00:17:46.440 --> 00:17:48.310
during the process of absorbing

00:17:48.310 --> 00:17:49.640
the Water-Control Orb.

00:17:50.150 --> 00:17:51.150
I understood her.

00:17:51.700 --> 00:17:53.760
After all, I was Quan Jingting's son.

00:17:54.200 --> 00:17:55.330
That surname,

00:17:55.920 --> 00:17:57.120
etched into my blood,

00:17:57.870 --> 00:17:58.920
was itself

00:17:59.430 --> 00:18:01.460
an invisible harm to her.

00:18:02.360 --> 00:18:03.490
And in my heart,

00:18:03.730 --> 00:18:05.990
I too lived with that same torment.

00:18:06.360 --> 00:18:07.350
I liked her,

00:18:07.960 --> 00:18:09.230
so I didn't blame her.

00:18:09.270 --> 00:18:11.750
I was willing to
bear all the pain for her.

00:18:12.440 --> 00:18:14.510
The pain from the backlash

00:18:15.310 --> 00:18:17.790
was actually easier to bear than
watching her forcibly swallow her hatred

00:18:17.790 --> 00:18:18.720
all those years.

00:18:52.110 --> 00:18:53.030
From now on...

00:18:54.830 --> 00:18:57.400
never give your true heart
to the wrong person again.

00:18:57.400 --> 00:18:59.400
The moment the Gu Mark disappeared,

00:18:59.480 --> 00:19:01.010
I suddenly wanted to laugh.

00:19:01.640 --> 00:19:03.930
It turned out she still didn't understand—

00:19:03.930 --> 00:19:05.270
from the moment

00:19:05.720 --> 00:19:07.920
she kidnapped me and healed my illness,

00:19:08.290 --> 00:19:09.250
my life

00:19:10.200 --> 00:19:11.800
had already belonged to her.

00:19:16.080 --> 00:19:17.080
It's not worth it.

00:19:18.790 --> 00:19:20.030
Why isn't it worth it?

00:19:20.750 --> 00:19:23.280
You struggled so hard
to survive as a child...

00:19:24.310 --> 00:19:26.770
yet you still mastered such swordsmanship.

00:19:28.070 --> 00:19:29.400
With talent like yours,

00:19:30.500 --> 00:19:32.470
you should never lay down your sword.

00:19:32.470 --> 00:19:32.960
Ah.

00:19:33.880 --> 00:19:36.010
I can accept you looking at me that way.

00:19:36.440 --> 00:19:37.920
I'm a fool, and I know it.

00:19:38.510 --> 00:19:39.440
Even so...

00:19:41.200 --> 00:19:42.350
I never hated her.

00:19:42.830 --> 00:19:43.750
How did you

00:19:44.270 --> 00:19:45.600
find out about all this?

00:19:48.680 --> 00:19:50.000
I only learned about it

00:19:50.750 --> 00:19:52.080
much later from others.

00:19:53.590 --> 00:19:54.790
I thought my father

00:19:55.030 --> 00:19:57.430
had merely played with her mother's heart.

00:19:58.820 --> 00:20:00.150
But who'd have known...

00:20:00.920 --> 00:20:02.310
I underestimated him.

00:20:03.590 --> 00:20:05.000
He somehow learned

00:20:05.000 --> 00:20:07.600
that Weiyun possessed
the Water-Control Orb.

00:20:07.650 --> 00:20:09.420
He also wanted that power.

00:20:09.960 --> 00:20:11.560
And at that time, Long Weiyun

00:20:11.790 --> 00:20:14.050
had just absorbed the Water-Control Orb

00:20:14.080 --> 00:20:15.970
and couldn't fully control it.

00:20:17.400 --> 00:20:18.890
He took advantage of it.

00:20:18.960 --> 00:20:20.320
Quan Jingting,

00:20:20.750 --> 00:20:21.510
today

00:20:21.650 --> 00:20:25.180
I'll make you suffer a hundredfold
for what you did to my mother!

00:20:27.200 --> 00:20:28.680
You dragon demons

00:20:29.890 --> 00:20:31.830
are really stupid.

00:20:32.700 --> 00:20:34.560
You actually walked into my trap.

00:20:35.520 --> 00:20:36.360
Kill her!

00:20:36.830 --> 00:20:39.720
Kill her!

00:21:09.880 --> 00:21:10.960
You just said

00:21:11.240 --> 00:21:13.910
you'd make me suffer a hundredfold
for the pain I caused your mother.

00:21:13.910 --> 00:21:15.080
Do you know

00:21:15.240 --> 00:21:17.300
how many times I cut off your mother's

00:21:17.670 --> 00:21:19.400
dragon horns as they grew back,

00:21:19.510 --> 00:21:20.070
huh?

00:21:27.590 --> 00:21:28.440
You bastard!

00:21:28.940 --> 00:21:30.880
I won't let you die so easily!

00:21:35.370 --> 00:21:37.940
Do you know how miserably she screamed

00:21:38.750 --> 00:21:40.950
when I scraped the scales from her body?

00:21:45.170 --> 00:21:46.640
Quan Jingting!

00:21:54.510 --> 00:21:55.720
Do you know...

00:21:57.200 --> 00:21:59.720
why only your mother's skull remains?

00:22:12.160 --> 00:22:13.700
I guessed right.

00:22:13.960 --> 00:22:15.510
A berserk dragon loses its sense of self.

00:22:15.510 --> 00:22:18.550
The violent power of the Water-Control Orb
will consume

00:22:18.550 --> 00:22:20.730
a True Dragon's mind.

00:22:59.690 --> 00:23:00.310
Oh no.

00:23:00.630 --> 00:23:02.690
I can't let Weiyun rush into the town!

00:23:03.990 --> 00:23:05.290
I must stop her here!

00:23:27.050 --> 00:23:28.240
I'll kill you!

00:23:28.880 --> 00:23:29.920
Even if I die,

00:23:30.640 --> 00:23:32.410
I won't allow my Weiyun

00:23:32.500 --> 00:23:33.790
to become so cruel!

00:24:00.750 --> 00:24:01.310
Weiyun,

00:24:01.920 --> 00:24:02.550
I know

00:24:02.880 --> 00:24:04.080
you wouldn't hurt me.

00:24:04.510 --> 00:24:05.480
You know it's me,

00:24:05.480 --> 00:24:06.160
right?

00:24:06.790 --> 00:24:07.350
Weiyun,

00:24:08.310 --> 00:24:09.240
I'm Rumu.

00:24:09.830 --> 00:24:10.680
The Rumu

00:24:10.840 --> 00:24:12.790
who has followed you since childhood!

00:24:12.790 --> 00:24:13.920
Have you forgotten?

00:24:14.410 --> 00:24:15.900
I'm Rumu!

00:24:19.920 --> 00:24:21.100
Quan...

00:24:21.720 --> 00:24:22.880
Rumu...

00:24:40.030 --> 00:24:40.750
Weiyun!

00:24:44.030 --> 00:24:44.740
Weiyun!

00:24:45.750 --> 00:24:46.480
Weiyun!

00:24:50.270 --> 00:24:51.330
I'll take you home.

00:24:53.440 --> 00:24:54.110
That day,

00:24:54.790 --> 00:24:56.990
Weiyun and I were both gravely injured.

00:24:57.120 --> 00:24:58.380
The Water-Control Orb

00:24:58.790 --> 00:25:00.390
