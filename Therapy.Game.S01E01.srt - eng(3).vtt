00:00:03.190 --> 00:00:06.290
Love is a game where everyone gets hurt.

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:10.870
You let your guard down,

00:00:11.740 --> 00:00:13.300
get played, then betrayed.

00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:15.480
And in the end, it's over, just like hitting reset.

00:00:18.780 --> 00:00:21.010
That's why I'll never get involved.

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:26.360
I swore I'd live by that rule...

00:00:30.360 --> 00:00:32.790
But yesterday, with this man...

00:00:35.220 --> 00:00:36.420
Game start.

00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:41.200
"Therapy Game"
(Episode 1)

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:28.590
What did he mean by having someone
he wanted to introduce me to?

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:33.700
And a college guy younger than me?

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:36.070
Are you kidding me?

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:42.100
Did he really have to ask me...?

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:44.070
Of course he did.

00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:47.070
Huh?

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:48.410
You always say that,

00:01:48.470 --> 00:01:50.870
but when have you not completely
messed up Itsuki-chan's love life?

00:01:51.470 --> 00:01:54.020
It's about time you grew out of that brother complex.

00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:58.580
Minato-chan, are you ready?

00:01:59.010 --> 00:02:00.210
Isn't it almost time?

00:02:01.540 --> 00:02:02.540
Oh...

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:03.690
You're right.

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:05.600
I'm heading out then.

00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:10.460
I'm just worried because we're brothers.

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:13.880
But...

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:15.340
you can't go sabotaging things, you hear?

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:18.380
I know.

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:29.810
Ooh.

00:02:32.740 --> 00:02:34.180
This is my younger brother, Minato.

00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:36.040
He's a freelance photographer.

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:37.810
He takes really good photos.

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:39.030
Oh.

00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:40.310
That's amazing!

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:43.420
My brother just takes blurry photos
with his phone.

00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:44.600
Huh?

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:46.160
Don't compare me to an amateur.

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:49.430
Minato.

00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:52.670
Sorry!

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:54.160
You have a point...

00:02:54.270 --> 00:02:56.410
It's like comparing a lion
to a house cat...

00:02:57.730 --> 00:02:58.730
Hmm?

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:00.000
Am I wrong?

00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:08.760
Ah, the delivery's here...

00:03:08.830 --> 00:03:10.030
Wait here for a sec, okay?

00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:23.010
Um...

00:03:23.050 --> 00:03:24.250
I'm just going to use the restroom.

00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:25.980
Hey, let me ask you something.

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:28.460
Did you know that guy used to

00:03:28.510 --> 00:03:30.200
have a really shady job?

00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:32.520
What?

00:03:33.100 --> 00:03:34.100
Shady, you say...?

00:03:35.590 --> 00:03:36.590
Come here for a second.

00:03:37.570 --> 00:03:38.370
No...

00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:39.660
I'd rather not.

00:03:40.010 --> 00:03:41.530
Didn't you hear me? I said come here.

00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:44.750
You want to know, don't you?

00:03:46.960 --> 00:03:48.380
The kind of work he did was...

00:03:48.410 --> 00:03:51.840
I'll accept all of it!

00:03:54.020 --> 00:03:56.450
If he were still doing it now,
I would absolutely stop him...

00:03:56.960 --> 00:03:58.720
No matter what kind of past Itsuki-san has,

00:03:59.130 --> 00:04:00.530
I will accept him for who he is.

00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:05.230
What an idiot.

00:04:15.250 --> 00:04:16.250
Minato?

00:04:16.470 --> 00:04:17.670
This is boring. I'm leaving.

00:04:34.340 --> 00:04:36.480
It's not that I hate you...

00:04:37.480 --> 00:04:38.680
But...

00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:40.580
I've fallen for Yusuke.

00:04:42.740 --> 00:04:44.060
I want to be with him.

00:04:44.560 --> 00:04:45.760
I'm so sorry!

00:04:50.310 --> 00:04:51.740
I'm sorry, I didn't realize.

00:04:55.160 --> 00:04:57.200
Yuka, you were suffering so much,

00:04:58.440 --> 00:04:59.930
and I didn't notice a thing...

00:05:03.510 --> 00:05:04.710
Right now...

00:05:05.990 --> 00:05:07.960
I can't think straight...

00:05:09.420 --> 00:05:10.620
Shizuma...

00:05:14.370 --> 00:05:20.370
- Hey, he just turned and left...
- He must be unwilling to accept it...

00:05:20.400 --> 00:05:23.200
(Veterinary School
Veterinary Surgery Lab)

00:05:43.210 --> 00:05:44.440
That guy...

00:05:44.790 --> 00:05:45.990
Did something happen to him?

00:05:47.200 --> 00:05:48.760
I heard he got dumped.

00:05:48.830 --> 00:05:49.830
What?

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:52.000
Yuka broke up with him?

00:05:52.560 --> 00:05:54.580
I heard she cheated on him.

00:05:56.430 --> 00:05:57.700
That's harsh...

00:05:59.020 --> 00:06:00.530
At a time like this,

00:06:00.850 --> 00:06:02.050
is where I come in.

00:06:02.090 --> 00:06:03.090
Hey, Shizuma.

00:06:03.760 --> 00:06:05.430
I'm here for you tonight!

00:06:06.400 --> 00:06:07.400
Let's drink our sorrows away

00:06:07.440 --> 00:06:09.620
and forget all about Yuka!

00:06:11.470 --> 00:06:12.470
It's really not a big deal.

00:06:12.940 --> 00:06:15.010
As long as Yuka is happy...

00:06:17.050 --> 00:06:18.820
What's there to be depressed about?

00:06:19.370 --> 00:06:21.200
In this day and age, one in every three men

00:06:21.210 --> 00:06:22.960
will be single for life.

00:06:24.430 --> 00:06:25.530
For life...

00:06:30.110 --> 00:06:31.110
About Shizuma...

00:06:31.480 --> 00:06:33.440
Did you forget what a handful he is when he's drunk?

00:06:34.120 --> 00:06:35.120
Ah...

00:06:35.910 --> 00:06:38.980
But jackals mate for life...

00:06:45.730 --> 00:06:46.730
I'm...

00:06:47.930 --> 00:06:48.930
heading out...

00:06:50.660 --> 00:06:51.660
You're coming too.

00:07:05.220 --> 00:07:06.620
Look at you.

00:07:06.870 --> 00:07:08.490
Is Itsuki-chan's new partner a good kid?

00:07:08.950 --> 00:07:09.950
Yeah.

00:07:09.970 --> 00:07:13.540
- I mean, a guy like a puppy...
- That's pretty rare.

00:07:13.590 --> 00:07:14.590
Right?

00:07:15.410 --> 00:07:18.430
My brother always used to date weirdos.

00:07:18.970 --> 00:07:20.900
I thought this time would be the same...

00:07:21.930 --> 00:07:22.930
Then...

00:07:22.980 --> 00:07:24.760
it's time for Minato-chan to graduate
from his brother complex.

00:07:25.300 --> 00:07:28.060
Even if you're brothers,
you can't be joined at the hip forever.

00:07:28.070 --> 00:07:31.370
I know... I know, but...

00:07:32.490 --> 00:07:34.070
I can't help but worry...

00:07:37.970 --> 00:07:39.410
I get it.

00:07:40.920 --> 00:07:42.120
That feeling...

00:07:42.580 --> 00:07:43.580
I get it!

00:07:44.410 --> 00:07:45.410
Huh?

00:07:45.530 --> 00:07:47.040
I have a younger brother too.

00:07:48.340 --> 00:07:49.640
That feeling of worry,

00:07:49.870 --> 00:07:51.430
I know it all too well.

00:07:53.310 --> 00:07:56.070
He's the type to wag his tail and follow anyone.

00:07:56.910 --> 00:07:58.560
It makes me so worried.

00:07:59.360 --> 00:08:00.360
Well, well, young man.

00:08:00.440 --> 00:08:01.640
You're finally awake?

00:08:01.800 --> 00:08:04.030
You've got some nerve
talking to Minato-chan.

00:08:04.030 --> 00:08:05.030
Mama-san.

00:08:09.170 --> 00:08:11.110
Hey, you guys.

00:08:12.240 --> 00:08:13.710
Your friend is awake!

00:08:13.880 --> 00:08:15.080
Oh, you're awake?

00:08:16.570 --> 00:08:17.570
Shizuma.

00:08:17.660 --> 00:08:18.660
Are you okay?

00:08:19.860 --> 00:08:20.860
Yeah.

00:08:21.030 --> 00:08:22.090
I'm fine~

00:08:22.750 --> 00:08:23.750
Really?

00:08:24.510 --> 00:08:25.810
Should I put your drink on the table for you?

00:08:25.840 --> 00:08:27.270
Oh, I'll get it.

00:08:29.240 --> 00:08:30.240
Hey.

00:08:30.650 --> 00:08:35.040
- We weren't done talking about leopard cats!
- I'm sick of hearing about it.

00:08:35.930 --> 00:08:37.720
Aren't you worried?

00:08:38.510 --> 00:08:40.460
They're so cute.

00:08:41.290 --> 00:08:45.580
- If they go extinct, we'll never see them again!
- I get it... I get it.

00:08:46.020 --> 00:08:49.690
Geez, Tatsumi is such a bad drunk...

00:08:53.460 --> 00:08:55.430
Don't worry about me.

00:08:57.060 --> 00:08:58.650
Go listen to Tatsumi.

00:08:59.880 --> 00:09:01.340
Huh? Okay, then...

00:09:01.660 --> 00:09:03.240
I'll let you know when we're leaving.

00:09:09.910 --> 00:09:12.050
Wouldn't it be better to have him take you home?

00:09:16.510 --> 00:09:19.040
You're even worried about me.

00:09:20.110 --> 00:09:21.540
You're such a good little brother.

00:09:23.250 --> 00:09:24.250
Yeah.

00:09:24.850 --> 00:09:26.940
There's no need to get over your brother complex!

00:09:27.160 --> 00:09:28.630
None at all!

00:09:29.560 --> 00:09:30.560
Hey, kid.

00:09:31.040 --> 00:09:32.780
Don't spoil this one too much.

00:09:33.050 --> 00:09:35.280
No, he's perfect just the way he is.

00:09:37.910 --> 00:09:38.910
Hey!

00:09:45.550 --> 00:09:46.960
We're not even family.

00:09:47.510 --> 00:09:50.290
I hate guys like this who don't know their boundaries.

00:09:52.520 --> 00:09:53.720
But...

00:09:56.470 --> 00:09:57.670
This guy here...

00:09:58.100 --> 00:09:59.820
I heard his girlfriend dumped him.

00:10:01.870 --> 00:10:02.870
I see.

00:10:03.290 --> 00:10:05.800
She cheated on me
without me even knowing...

00:10:06.330 --> 00:10:08.570
She said she liked the new guy more...

00:10:10.270 --> 00:10:11.610
and so she left me.

00:10:13.780 --> 00:10:14.780
See?

00:10:15.080 --> 00:10:16.080
This guy too.

00:10:17.060 --> 00:10:19.310
This is why love only leads to pain.

00:10:24.260 --> 00:10:26.000
If you're so unwilling to accept it,

00:10:26.570 --> 00:10:28.030
you should get revenge.

00:10:28.970 --> 00:10:31.000
Make her feel the same pain.

00:10:34.280 --> 00:10:36.030
I am unwilling to accept it.

00:10:37.320 --> 00:10:38.520
But even so,

00:10:39.300 --> 00:10:41.180
there's no point in hurting her.

00:10:45.180 --> 00:10:47.360
She chose to end things this way.

00:10:48.480 --> 00:10:51.560
I'd be more upset if she wasn't happier now
than she was with me.

00:10:55.510 --> 00:10:56.510
But...

00:10:58.100 --> 00:11:01.540
It's too scary... I don't think
I can ever fall in love again...

00:11:09.740 --> 00:11:11.910
Someone like you...

00:11:12.300 --> 00:11:13.670
deserves to be happy.

00:11:20.850 --> 00:11:22.600
That's the first time anyone's ever said that to me.

00:11:29.710 --> 00:11:31.720
Aren't you in a bad mood today too?

00:11:35.230 --> 00:11:36.690
Let's just drink our sorrows away.

00:11:39.530 --> 00:11:41.500
I never thought I'd make a move on a straight guy...

00:11:44.360 --> 00:11:45.460
Until...

00:11:48.090 --> 00:11:49.090
Shizuma.

00:11:49.320 --> 00:11:50.520
Watch where you're going!

00:11:51.590 --> 00:11:53.330
You're a big guy, you're heavy!

00:11:54.300 --> 00:11:55.300
Mmm.

00:11:57.720 --> 00:11:59.860
Human's body heat is so warm~

00:12:03.160 --> 00:12:04.740
Geez, where did your friends go?

00:12:06.840 --> 00:12:07.840
Whoa!

00:12:16.730 --> 00:12:18.450
Want to rest for a bit before we keep going?

00:12:21.990 --> 00:12:23.640
You're in no shape to get home like this.

00:12:24.990 --> 00:12:25.990
Mmm.

00:12:26.110 --> 00:12:27.110
Mmm.

00:12:44.930 --> 00:12:47.640
And I can't just leave you
here by yourself.

00:12:50.320 --> 00:12:51.520
Thank you...

00:12:51.990 --> 00:12:52.990
Minato.

00:13:03.680 --> 00:13:05.230
Feeling better?

00:13:07.460 --> 00:13:08.460
Yeah.

00:13:09.800 --> 00:13:10.800
What about you, Minato?

00:13:12.100 --> 00:13:13.570
Are you all right now?

00:13:14.960 --> 00:13:17.890
My wounds are different from yours.

00:13:18.530 --> 00:13:20.480
Someone stole my precious brother from me.

00:13:24.940 --> 00:13:26.140
Then...

00:13:27.620 --> 00:13:29.780
I'll take your brother's place.

00:13:38.050 --> 00:13:39.050
Wait...

00:13:39.430 --> 00:13:40.860
You're getting a little too handsy.

00:13:41.550 --> 00:13:42.750
You don't like it?

00:13:44.400 --> 00:13:46.370
I thought you were enjoying it.

00:13:46.400 --> 00:13:48.400
Huh? Why would I be enjoying it?

00:13:50.110 --> 00:13:51.110
Because...

00:13:53.770 --> 00:13:54.980
Even though you say that,

00:13:56.460 --> 00:13:57.660
you didn't pull away.

00:14:07.090 --> 00:14:08.740
It's okay to be honest and lean on me.

00:14:11.900 --> 00:14:13.100
I told you...

00:14:20.900 --> 00:14:22.360
You're drunk.

00:14:22.820 --> 00:14:23.820
Hey.

00:14:28.390 --> 00:14:29.390
Minato.

00:14:47.100 --> 00:14:48.490
I thought, "I've finally found the one."

00:14:50.700 --> 00:14:52.680
It's not really like me,

00:14:54.740 --> 00:14:55.940
but...

00:15:17.260 --> 00:15:18.460
Yuka...

00:15:18.900 --> 00:15:19.900
The alarm.

00:15:32.660 --> 00:15:35.000
Shizuma, I'm not Yuka.

00:15:36.700 --> 00:15:37.700
I'm...

00:15:37.820 --> 00:15:38.820
Minato.

00:15:46.500 --> 00:15:47.500
Huh?

00:15:55.290 --> 00:15:56.290
Who are you?

00:15:57.140 --> 00:15:58.140
Hmm?

00:16:00.040 --> 00:16:01.040
Don't tell me...

00:16:01.670 --> 00:16:03.250
You don't remember me?

00:16:06.900 --> 00:16:07.900
Sorry.

00:16:08.770 --> 00:16:10.300
I don't remember a thing.

00:16:20.260 --> 00:16:21.460
I see...

00:16:25.050 --> 00:16:27.730
You were black-out drunk yesterday.

00:16:29.850 --> 00:16:32.160
It's no wonder you can't remember.

00:16:35.340 --> 00:16:36.890
Hey! What are you doing?

00:16:37.080 --> 00:16:38.880
- Untie me!
- But...

00:16:41.510 --> 00:16:42.670
What you did to me...

00:16:43.210 --> 00:16:44.750
I'm not going to let you pretend it never happened.

00:16:45.620 --> 00:16:47.270
Hey! What do you think you're doing?

00:16:47.270 --> 00:16:48.370
Untie me, now!

00:16:49.810 --> 00:16:51.570
Since you're so gentle,

00:16:51.980 --> 00:16:54.180
you wouldn't break something precious to me, would you?

00:16:57.760 --> 00:17:00.170
I thought if we did the same thing as yesterday,
you might remember.

00:17:02.290 --> 00:17:03.950
This is useless!

00:17:04.190 --> 00:17:05.190
Let me go!

00:17:05.200 --> 00:17:06.830
Then what will it take for you to remember?

00:17:08.140 --> 00:17:09.340
Tell me.

00:17:13.840 --> 00:17:16.280
Who was it that brought you here
when you were completely wasted?

00:17:20.840 --> 00:17:22.050
What's my name?

00:17:30.110 --> 00:17:32.010
You're the one who came on to me first.

00:17:33.080 --> 00:17:35.250
And now you're acting like you don't know me.

00:17:37.920 --> 00:17:39.390
You're the worst.

00:17:42.850 --> 00:17:44.790
I think you have a point.

00:17:44.920 --> 00:17:47.490
But I can't just accept being treated like this.

00:17:47.530 --> 00:17:49.180
- Let's talk this out...
- No.

00:17:50.650 --> 00:17:52.770
If you feel bad, then just lie back and take it.

00:17:56.270 --> 00:17:57.270
I can't.

00:17:58.000 --> 00:17:59.000
Why?

00:17:59.420 --> 00:18:01.050
I'll make you feel good.

00:18:02.650 --> 00:18:04.080
I didn't ask you to!

00:18:05.340 --> 00:18:07.380
Just lie still.

00:18:08.730 --> 00:18:09.730
Stop it!

00:18:10.620 --> 00:18:11.620
I won't.

00:18:11.950 --> 00:18:13.910
I told you to stop, didn't you hear me?

00:18:15.050 --> 00:18:16.250
Wait!

00:18:16.530 --> 00:18:17.730
Shizuma, that hurts!

00:18:18.570 --> 00:18:20.340
Will you listen to me now?

00:18:20.690 --> 00:18:21.690
I'll listen...

00:18:22.170 --> 00:18:23.200
I'll listen!

00:18:27.830 --> 00:18:29.370
Just untie me first!

00:18:38.820 --> 00:18:41.340
Damn it. I should've tied your feet too.

00:18:46.890 --> 00:18:49.370
Are you always this forceful?

00:18:50.590 --> 00:18:51.790
So what if I am?

00:18:53.370 --> 00:18:55.330
If you're always this aggressive,

00:18:55.520 --> 00:18:57.130
you'll never win anyone over.

00:19:01.720 --> 00:19:03.090
You'll be alone forever.

00:19:06.920 --> 00:19:07.920
What?

00:19:10.590 --> 00:19:11.850
This is edited so beautifully.

00:19:12.760 --> 00:19:14.270
It looks professional.

00:19:16.960 --> 00:19:20.440
Oh my, everyone's photos are so pretty.

00:19:20.740 --> 00:19:24.240
- Mama-san, yours is the best.
- Hanako looks gorgeous.

00:19:24.370 --> 00:19:26.180
Isn't this a little over-edited?

00:19:26.280 --> 00:19:27.280
What is it?

00:19:28.730 --> 00:19:29.730
It's so beautiful.

00:19:30.000 --> 00:19:31.430
He said he doesn't remember a thing.

00:19:32.080 --> 00:19:35.490
- Are you kidding me?
- You're still on about that?

00:19:36.590 --> 00:19:39.350
Don't I always say you should just move on?

00:19:40.360 --> 00:19:41.920
A heartbroken straight guy...

00:19:42.000 --> 00:19:43.400
Just forget about him.

00:19:45.420 --> 00:19:46.960
Does this mean I got dumped?

00:19:49.030 --> 00:19:50.660
It's okay to be honest and lean on me.

00:19:56.790 --> 00:19:58.130
No...

00:19:58.470 --> 00:20:01.590
He may have been drunk,
but he was the one who made the first move.

00:20:02.680 --> 00:20:04.160
He may be straight,

00:20:04.530 --> 00:20:06.560
but that guy definitely has potential.

00:20:07.010 --> 00:20:11.130
Besides, when a man is heartbroken,
that's the perfect time to make your move, isn't it?

00:20:11.530 --> 00:20:12.730
Hanako!

00:20:12.850 --> 00:20:14.050
Then how about we make a bet?

00:20:14.490 --> 00:20:17.360
If Mr. Minato can win over that straight guy,

00:20:17.520 --> 00:20:19.130
I'll shave my head.

00:20:20.190 --> 00:20:21.530
Honestly, you guys.

00:20:22.010 --> 00:20:23.710
Stop egging him on!

00:20:24.380 --> 00:20:25.690
Fine. I'll show you.

00:20:27.260 --> 00:20:30.060
I'll mend his broken heart,

00:20:31.350 --> 00:20:33.840
and then I'll dump him hard!

00:20:37.380 --> 00:20:38.580
In that case, Minato-chan,

00:20:39.870 --> 00:20:41.600
I'd like you to run an errand for me.

00:20:46.180 --> 00:20:47.380
This...

00:20:48.910 --> 00:20:50.110
Could you deliver this for me?

00:20:51.950 --> 00:20:52.950
Huh?

00:21:03.170 --> 00:21:05.390
Mama-san, why are you making him go?

00:21:07.640 --> 00:21:10.480
To see that kid so fixated
on someone besides Itsuki-chan...

00:21:10.920 --> 00:21:12.120
It's really quite a sight.

00:21:28.380 --> 00:21:30.100
My mission in this game...

00:21:30.180 --> 00:21:32.410
is to make this guy fall for me
and then dump him.

00:21:33.760 --> 00:21:36.170
There's no way I'm going to let him
hurt me and get away with it.

00:21:43.550 --> 00:21:46.030
Just wait until I crush you under my heel.

00:22:30.460 --> 00:22:33.210
(Next Episode Preview)
First, I'll lead you on.

00:22:33.290 --> 00:22:34.290
What on earth happened?

00:22:34.360 --> 00:22:35.660
If rumors spread that you got dumped by a woman,

00:22:35.660 --> 00:22:37.610
and then started dating a man,
what would you do about the gossip?

00:22:37.730 --> 00:22:39.190
The boundaries Shizuma can accept...

00:22:39.220 --> 00:22:40.590
I'll figure them out for you.

00:22:40.670 --> 00:22:41.670
Towards a man...

00:22:41.740 --> 00:22:44.340
What if I'm feeling my heart race for him
like never before?
