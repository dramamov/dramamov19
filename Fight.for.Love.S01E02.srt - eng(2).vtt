00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:55.560
Who do you think they are?

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:57.710
Just a bunch of people leaning on

00:01:57.710 --> 00:01:58.760
family status

00:01:58.760 --> 00:02:00.400
to act recklessly, calling themselves

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:01.790
gentlemen and ladies while only

00:02:01.790 --> 00:02:03.560
gossiping behind others' backs.

00:02:04.230 --> 00:02:05.870
So it's Lady Chu.

00:02:06.150 --> 00:02:07.350
No wonder you didn't

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:08.520
recognize me at first.

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:10.030
What?

00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:12.150
Rejected by Young General Wei

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:14.030
and now you come

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:15.960
to Qinxi Valley to fish for

00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:17.430
another rich groom?

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:27.310
Mr. Cao,

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:28.800
no need for more words.

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:31.280
Academician Gu may be awkward

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:32.520
to step forward because of his past.

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:33.710
Ms. Wang,

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:35.520
what are you afraid of?

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:37.150
Do you expect

00:02:37.630 --> 00:02:38.840
the defeated Chu Jianchang

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:39.800
to crawl out

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:41.310
of his coffin

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:42.150
and defend her?

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:46.150
Don't be rash.

00:02:52.630 --> 00:02:53.470
Who?

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:54.520
Who is it?

00:02:56.030 --> 00:02:57.000
Who hit me in the head?

00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:15.710
Brother Wei.

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:19.310
I'm late to the appointment.

00:03:19.310 --> 00:03:20.750
Please forgive the delay.

00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:22.360
Young General Wei,

00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:24.080
both of us serve the court,

00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:25.470
don't blame me for warning you:

00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:27.590
with Lady Chu's reputation,

00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:29.310
keep your distance

00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:30.640
or

00:03:30.910 --> 00:03:32.590
your Marquis Mansion's honor may be sullied.

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:41.310
Cao Yan,

00:03:41.710 --> 00:03:42.960
as Minister of Justice,

00:03:43.310 --> 00:03:44.150
your words

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:45.560
are coarse and crude.

00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:46.400
Wei Jun,

00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:48.470
I give you courtesy

00:03:48.960 --> 00:03:50.310
because of your father,

00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:52.520
otherwise would I, Minister of Justice,

00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:53.840
fear you?

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:58.310
Earlier, you called me a child,

00:03:58.800 --> 00:03:59.750
and now, I'm the one

00:03:59.750 --> 00:04:00.870
defending you here.

00:04:02.150 --> 00:04:03.750
So it was you who hit me.

00:04:04.520 --> 00:04:05.360
You...

00:04:12.870 --> 00:04:14.240
You conspirators,

00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:16.040
plotting against an imperial official!

00:04:16.360 --> 00:04:18.000
How many heads will be enough?

00:04:18.510 --> 00:04:20.270
I will not let you go.

00:05:14.270 --> 00:05:15.110
Are you all right?

00:05:15.830 --> 00:05:16.670
I'm fine.

00:05:24.800 --> 00:05:26.270
Lady Chu and my Seventh Brother

00:05:26.510 --> 00:05:27.800
truly have an odd fate.

00:05:32.430 --> 00:05:33.270
Chu Yu,

00:05:33.680 --> 00:05:34.520
Wei Jun,

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:36.270
and you brat,

00:05:36.430 --> 00:05:37.920
you coarse men-at-arms!

00:05:37.920 --> 00:05:38.760
True,

00:05:39.560 --> 00:05:41.240
we are soldiers,

00:05:41.560 --> 00:05:43.000
but soldiers who protect Great Sui's

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:44.160
people and keep peace.

00:05:45.040 --> 00:05:46.600
Lady Chu's family are meritous.

00:05:47.430 --> 00:05:48.390
You shall not slander them

00:05:48.390 --> 00:05:49.430
like this.

00:05:50.680 --> 00:05:52.310
Fine, fine.

00:05:52.870 --> 00:05:55.360
The humiliations you heaped upon me today,

00:05:56.560 --> 00:05:57.400
I will make you

00:05:57.720 --> 00:05:59.600
repay tenfold someday.

00:06:12.920 --> 00:06:14.120
The Young General speaks rightly.

00:06:14.800 --> 00:06:16.000
Let this end here.

00:06:21.240 --> 00:06:22.670
Let's go home.

00:06:32.160 --> 00:06:33.240
I was only trying to scare him.

00:06:33.240 --> 00:06:34.600
How would I know the Minister of Justice

00:06:34.600 --> 00:06:35.440
would...

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:39.000
You got your hands dirty.

00:06:39.630 --> 00:06:40.470
I...

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:45.920
Thank you,

00:06:45.920 --> 00:06:47.270
Brother Wei, for your help today.

00:06:47.270 --> 00:06:48.920
I will thank you properly another day.

00:06:49.950 --> 00:06:51.720
Lady Chu, don't take Cao Yan's words

00:06:51.720 --> 00:06:52.560
to heart.

00:06:53.430 --> 00:06:55.560
I certainly won't take them to heart.

00:06:55.950 --> 00:06:57.040
Brother Wei, let's go for a walk.

00:06:58.480 --> 00:06:59.320
Alright.

00:07:15.070 --> 00:07:16.000
Okay, got it.

00:07:16.750 --> 00:07:18.240
I'll take my leave now.

00:07:25.120 --> 00:07:25.960
Don't stray too far.

00:07:47.720 --> 00:07:49.240
This is today's route for

00:07:49.240 --> 00:07:50.720
Young General Wei and Wei Yun.

00:07:51.600 --> 00:07:52.440
General,

00:07:52.920 --> 00:07:54.040
how are you so sure

00:07:54.390 --> 00:07:55.360
he'd go to

00:07:55.360 --> 00:07:56.200
the Arsenal Bureau today?

00:07:59.830 --> 00:08:00.750
Born to a military house,

00:08:01.240 --> 00:08:02.080
you trust yourself,

00:08:02.830 --> 00:08:04.310
the banner behind you,

00:08:04.720 --> 00:08:06.240
and the soldiers at your side.

00:08:07.070 --> 00:08:07.800
Yesterday Chu Yu

00:08:07.800 --> 00:08:09.450
(Chushan, Chu Linyang's Guard)
told him the octagonal crossbow

00:08:09.460 --> 00:08:10.930
(Chushan, Chu Linyang's Guard)
appeared in North Qi hands,

00:08:11.190 --> 00:08:12.160
how could he not go

00:08:12.160 --> 00:08:13.870
check the Arsenal Bureau

00:08:14.360 --> 00:08:15.360
to see what happened?

00:08:19.120 --> 00:08:21.480
So the Arsenal Bureau's true location

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:24.120
lies in the movements

00:08:24.120 --> 00:08:25.270
of the Wei brothers.

00:08:26.950 --> 00:08:29.510
(I hope Chu Yu makes progress.)

00:09:25.120 --> 00:09:25.960
Brother Wei,

00:09:26.360 --> 00:09:27.200
when I

00:09:27.200 --> 00:09:29.390
confessed to you atop Spring Breeze House,

00:09:30.510 --> 00:09:32.840
I didn't think it through.

00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:35.030
You may publicly

00:09:35.200 --> 00:09:36.750
refuse me there another day

00:09:37.150 --> 00:09:38.910
and save Wei family face.

00:09:41.320 --> 00:09:42.910
Lady Chu, do not take it to heart.

00:09:43.670 --> 00:09:45.440
I don't mind.

00:09:46.790 --> 00:09:48.440
The octagonal crossbow's instant trigger

00:09:48.440 --> 00:09:50.030
comes from the Arsenal Bureau's craft,

00:09:50.870 --> 00:09:52.320
so I cannot be fully blameless.

00:09:53.030 --> 00:09:53.910
What you said

00:09:54.240 --> 00:09:55.200
matters not only

00:09:55.200 --> 00:09:56.060
to me but tightens

00:09:56.060 --> 00:09:57.550
the noose on the Wei family,

00:09:57.750 --> 00:09:58.670
and for Great Sui

00:09:59.080 --> 00:09:59.920
as a whole.

00:10:00.630 --> 00:10:01.470
I will

00:10:01.840 --> 00:10:03.720
investigate this thoroughly.

00:10:04.150 --> 00:10:05.670
Can't I investigate with you?

00:10:07.670 --> 00:10:09.550
If the Chu family is suspected of
colluding with the enemy

00:10:09.790 --> 00:10:11.750
and the Wei family is suspected of treason,

00:10:12.270 --> 00:10:13.150
the stakes are high.

00:10:14.200 --> 00:10:15.240
You have your public plan,

00:10:15.790 --> 00:10:16.960
I have my worries.

00:10:18.670 --> 00:10:19.550
But I promise,

00:10:19.840 --> 00:10:20.910
after I investigate,

00:10:21.360 --> 00:10:23.150
I will explain everything to you.

00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:35.840
I...

00:10:43.630 --> 00:10:45.480
This is what I found in the grove just now.

00:10:48.550 --> 00:10:49.390
Yun?

00:10:52.360 --> 00:10:54.120
It was nearly frozen,

00:10:54.120 --> 00:10:55.790
so I kept it warm in my arms.

00:10:56.150 --> 00:10:57.840
When it revived

00:10:57.840 --> 00:10:59.550
it scampered everywhere.

00:11:06.870 --> 00:11:08.120
If you want it,

00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:09.910
you can have it.

00:11:20.480 --> 00:11:21.390
Why do you fall silent

00:11:21.390 --> 00:11:22.600
as soon as I arrive?

00:11:30.600 --> 00:11:32.200
Lady Chu, please send my regards

00:11:32.200 --> 00:11:34.390
to Young General Chu.

00:11:35.600 --> 00:11:36.510
Thank you, Brother Wei.

00:11:37.840 --> 00:11:38.840
We'll meet again another day.

00:11:41.150 --> 00:11:41.990
Let's go.

00:11:52.510 --> 00:11:53.350
My Lady.

00:11:54.150 --> 00:11:55.000
Did you find the spot?

00:11:55.870 --> 00:11:57.360
I followed that General Wei

00:11:57.360 --> 00:11:58.600
up a ridge.

00:11:58.750 --> 00:12:00.120
He's like a rabbit,

00:12:00.390 --> 00:12:01.360
extremely swift,

00:12:01.510 --> 00:12:02.960
with a crafty guard.

00:12:03.510 --> 00:12:04.750
I lost him when I

00:12:05.240 --> 00:12:06.150
wasn't careful.

00:12:07.030 --> 00:12:07.870
No matter.

00:12:08.390 --> 00:12:10.030
The Arsenal Bureau is extremely important

00:12:10.240 --> 00:12:11.240
for Great Sui.

00:12:11.960 --> 00:12:13.080
It won't be easy to find.

00:12:14.840 --> 00:12:16.120
Finding the exact ridge

00:12:16.120 --> 00:12:16.960
is already good.

00:12:17.240 --> 00:12:18.150
Tomorrow,

00:12:18.150 --> 00:12:19.510
I'll scout it myself.

00:12:22.510 --> 00:12:23.350
Go now.

00:12:31.960 --> 00:12:33.000
I'm exhausted.

00:12:33.240 --> 00:12:34.240
Today Wei Qiu and I

00:12:34.240 --> 00:12:35.080
ran back and forth.

00:12:35.750 --> 00:12:37.030
When I asked for personnel files,

00:12:37.030 --> 00:12:38.600
do you know how the deputy commander

00:12:38.600 --> 00:12:39.480
responded?

00:12:40.600 --> 00:12:42.030
He's strange

00:12:42.030 --> 00:12:43.000
and headstrong.

00:12:43.390 --> 00:12:45.000
I suppose he refused.

00:12:45.510 --> 00:12:46.350
Yes.

00:12:49.270 --> 00:12:50.510
He even asked

00:12:50.960 --> 00:12:52.840
whether you had time to go to the Arsenal.

00:12:54.520 --> 00:12:55.360
If you cannot, he said

00:12:55.360 --> 00:12:56.480
he could come find you.

00:12:57.630 --> 00:12:59.360
Jun, are you toying with me?

00:12:59.870 --> 00:13:01.030
Of course not.

00:13:01.960 --> 00:13:02.960
I sent you

00:13:03.240 --> 00:13:04.960
because someone is watching me.

00:13:05.360 --> 00:13:06.240
This is serious.

00:13:11.720 --> 00:13:12.840
Lady Chu?

00:13:19.270 --> 00:13:20.840
How could it be her?

00:13:20.840 --> 00:13:21.840
Of course not.

00:13:22.870 --> 00:13:23.720
Jun,

00:13:23.720 --> 00:13:24.630
between you and Lady Chu,

00:13:24.630 --> 00:13:25.720
is this real?

00:13:32.750 --> 00:13:33.590
Jun,

00:13:34.960 --> 00:13:35.870
Lady Chu

00:13:35.870 --> 00:13:37.510
may be odd,

00:13:38.240 --> 00:13:39.090
but you mustn't

00:13:39.100 --> 00:13:40.200
toy with her feelings.

00:13:41.840 --> 00:13:43.270
Do you think I would

00:13:43.270 --> 00:13:46.000
deceive a woman's heart?

00:13:48.270 --> 00:13:49.120
Of course not.

00:13:52.120 --> 00:13:53.480
In my eyes,

00:13:53.480 --> 00:13:55.080
you're one of Great Sui's finest.

00:13:55.670 --> 00:13:56.670
Ye deserve

00:13:56.670 --> 00:13:57.870
the best woman.

00:14:00.870 --> 00:14:01.750
I fear you may

00:14:01.750 --> 00:14:02.750
fall for her beauty trap.

00:14:03.270 --> 00:14:04.480
You're paying

00:14:04.480 --> 00:14:06.080
extra attention to Lady Chu.

00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:08.390
Do you think she's beautiful?

00:14:11.510 --> 00:14:12.350
I...

00:14:29.750 --> 00:14:30.590
I...

00:14:31.360 --> 00:14:33.150
I'm telling you business here.

00:14:34.360 --> 00:14:35.200
Fine.

00:14:35.480 --> 00:14:36.320
Let me ask you,

00:14:36.510 --> 00:14:38.720
what is the best woman in the world?

00:14:47.720 --> 00:14:49.750
There are many women,

00:14:50.360 --> 00:14:52.360
but the one you love

00:14:52.510 --> 00:14:53.750
is the best.

00:14:59.630 --> 00:15:00.600
I really want to know

00:15:00.600 --> 00:15:02.270
what you will be like

00:15:02.270 --> 00:15:03.360
after marriage.

00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:05.840
Will you

00:15:06.120 --> 00:15:07.390
stay as mischievous?

00:15:09.630 --> 00:15:10.470
I...

00:15:14.390 --> 00:15:15.230
See you later.

00:15:34.900 --> 00:15:37.580
(Tong; General Wei Jun)

00:15:48.960 --> 00:15:51.080
This is the instant trigger
from the octagonal crossbow.

00:15:51.360 --> 00:15:52.200
You...

00:15:52.200 --> 00:15:53.270
This was brought back

00:15:53.960 --> 00:15:55.150
at great risk by my brother

00:15:55.600 --> 00:15:57.270
from the Fengling battlefield.

00:15:57.630 --> 00:15:58.870
It's made by North Qi.

00:15:59.840 --> 00:16:01.600
Brother Wei, I know you're upright.

00:16:02.080 --> 00:16:02.960
To investigate

00:16:02.960 --> 00:16:04.000
you need evidence.

00:16:04.390 --> 00:16:05.390
If my brother distrusts you,

00:16:05.960 --> 00:16:07.120
I'll believe you once.

00:16:09.960 --> 00:16:11.870
(If there's a traitor in the Arsenal Bureau,)

00:16:12.840 --> 00:16:13.870
(who might it be?)

00:16:19.960 --> 00:16:21.150
Urgent news!

00:16:21.840 --> 00:16:22.960
Urgent news!

00:16:26.150 --> 00:16:27.240
Urgent news!

00:16:27.240 --> 00:16:29.620
(Chengqing Gate)

00:16:29.620 --> 00:16:30.460
(Loyalty and Valor)

00:17:13.440 --> 00:17:14.280
Jun,

00:17:14.590 --> 00:17:15.680
if I win today,

00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:16.840
when we next march,

00:17:17.270 --> 00:17:18.110
you'll ask Father to let me

00:17:18.130 --> 00:17:19.450
skip the drawing of lots for duty, alright?

00:17:19.920 --> 00:17:21.050
I want to return to the battlefield.

00:17:21.510 --> 00:17:22.350
Yun,

00:17:22.790 --> 00:17:24.510
you know Father's rules.

00:17:25.400 --> 00:17:26.240
Yun,

00:17:26.510 --> 00:17:27.440
you've gone to war

00:17:27.440 --> 00:17:28.280
three times in a row.

00:17:28.880 --> 00:17:30.160
Give your brothers

00:17:30.960 --> 00:17:32.070
a chance.

00:17:37.000 --> 00:17:38.680
Qin, it's just bad luck you drew guard duty

00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:40.400
three times in a row.

00:17:41.310 --> 00:17:42.660
Jun, watch this move!

00:18:00.440 --> 00:18:01.280
In five moves,

00:18:01.510 --> 00:18:02.480
Yun will lose.

00:18:02.830 --> 00:18:03.830
That's already good.

00:18:04.030 --> 00:18:05.440
Previously he couldn't last

00:18:05.440 --> 00:18:06.680
two hundred moves against Jun.

00:18:06.830 --> 00:18:07.790
Now

00:18:07.790 --> 00:18:08.960
it's nearly even.

00:18:09.260 --> 00:18:10.110
Indeed,

00:18:10.110 --> 00:18:11.590
at Yun's age

00:18:11.590 --> 00:18:12.750
I could never beat Jun.

00:18:29.830 --> 00:18:30.670
- Father.
- Father.

00:18:31.030 --> 00:18:31.870
Father.

00:18:44.680 --> 00:18:45.830
His Majesty commands:

00:18:46.720 --> 00:18:47.750
North Qi is agitating;

00:18:48.350 --> 00:18:49.550
the northern border is urgent.

00:18:50.110 --> 00:18:51.110
The Wei army

00:18:51.960 --> 00:18:53.440
will mobilize at once

00:18:53.720 --> 00:18:54.920
to respond.

00:18:55.350 --> 00:18:57.040
Yes!

00:19:00.240 --> 00:19:01.790
- Jun.
- Yun,

00:19:01.790 --> 00:19:03.000
I have somewhere to go.

00:19:03.480 --> 00:19:04.590
I'll be back soon.

00:19:16.590 --> 00:19:17.750
Go pick up some cloth later,

00:19:18.070 --> 00:19:19.020
- don't forget.
- Yes.

00:19:21.940 --> 00:19:23.900
(Chu Mansion)

00:19:26.590 --> 00:19:27.430
Young General Wei.

00:19:27.960 --> 00:19:29.960
Please tell Lady Chu Yu,

00:19:30.160 --> 00:19:31.110
Wei Jun requests

00:19:31.240 --> 00:19:32.080
an urgent message.

00:19:32.350 --> 00:19:33.790
Lady Chu is out and hasn't come home.

00:19:34.000 --> 00:19:35.830
General Wei, perhaps you should

00:19:35.830 --> 00:19:36.670
wait a while?

00:19:39.640 --> 00:19:40.590
No, better not.

00:19:40.590 --> 00:19:42.440
That would damage your household's reputation.

00:19:45.110 --> 00:19:46.830
Please deliver this letter

00:19:47.070 --> 00:19:48.070
to Lady Chu.

00:19:50.000 --> 00:19:50.840
Farewell.

00:19:50.840 --> 00:19:54.940
(Chu Mansion)

00:20:01.820 --> 00:20:04.300
(Chu Mansion)

00:20:06.660 --> 00:20:09.660
(True Might)

00:20:14.810 --> 00:20:15.680
Is Xie Jiu

00:20:15.680 --> 00:20:16.830
still sulking with you?

00:20:17.750 --> 00:20:18.830
We're still the same,

00:20:19.510 --> 00:20:20.830
familiar,

00:20:21.640 --> 00:20:22.480
yet distant.

00:20:25.510 --> 00:20:26.350
Yun,

00:20:26.350 --> 00:20:27.310
believe me or not,

00:20:27.790 --> 00:20:29.830
the unlucky rear-guard post this time

00:20:29.830 --> 00:20:31.440
- is yours.
- Don't curse me.

00:20:31.640 --> 00:20:32.920
I'm not just going to the front,

00:20:33.400 --> 00:20:34.960
I'll crush North Qi completely.

00:20:35.470 --> 00:20:36.310
When they hear my name,

00:20:36.310 --> 00:20:37.310
Wei Yun,

00:20:37.440 --> 00:20:38.440
they'll flee in terror.

00:20:40.240 --> 00:20:41.080
First draw gets the spot!

00:20:41.790 --> 00:20:43.320
Yun, don't cheat.

00:20:48.300 --> 00:20:49.980
(Rear Guard)

00:20:52.240 --> 00:20:53.200
Yun.

00:20:55.440 --> 00:20:56.440
Looks like I was right.

00:20:56.440 --> 00:20:57.720
Doesn't count, let's draw again!

00:20:57.720 --> 00:20:58.830
- Impossible.
- Let me draw again!

00:20:58.830 --> 00:20:59.670
Yun,

00:20:59.830 --> 00:21:01.270
it's already settled.

00:21:01.790 --> 00:21:02.680
You can't

00:21:02.880 --> 00:21:03.750
go back on it.

00:21:09.640 --> 00:21:10.550
Yun.

00:21:12.980 --> 00:21:16.220
(True Might)

00:21:20.350 --> 00:21:21.190
Zhong,

00:21:22.750 --> 00:21:24.350
why are you leaving

00:21:24.350 --> 00:21:25.680
earlier than planned?

00:21:27.510 --> 00:21:28.440
Don't worry,

00:21:28.720 --> 00:21:29.680
I'll return

00:21:30.240 --> 00:21:31.080
victorious.

00:21:37.510 --> 00:21:38.350
My dear sons,

00:21:39.510 --> 00:21:40.590
take care of yourselves,

00:21:41.240 --> 00:21:42.440
and your father.

00:21:43.440 --> 00:21:44.510
Don't worry, Mother.

00:22:28.900 --> 00:22:30.300
(Marquis of Zhenguo's Mansion)

00:22:30.310 --> 00:22:31.150
Depart!

00:22:33.720 --> 00:22:43.780
May you return victorious!

00:22:43.780 --> 00:22:46.460
(Wei)
May you return victorious!

00:22:46.460 --> 00:22:50.070
May you return victorious!

00:22:50.070 --> 00:22:50.910
My Lady.

00:22:51.200 --> 00:22:52.110
Chu Shan,

00:22:52.110 --> 00:22:53.110
why are you standing outside?

00:22:53.310 --> 00:22:54.160
Let me tell you,

00:22:54.160 --> 00:22:55.310
I'm exhausted today.

00:22:55.640 --> 00:22:57.160
If not for fear of arousing suspicion,

00:22:57.160 --> 00:22:58.310
I'd have brought more men

00:22:58.310 --> 00:22:59.160
to find the Arsenal Bureau.

00:22:59.400 --> 00:23:00.880
- Earlier...
- I've been running all day.

00:23:02.510 --> 00:23:03.350
- I...
- What's the matter?

00:23:03.880 --> 00:23:05.070
What is it? Speak.

00:23:07.240 --> 00:23:08.200
While you were out,

00:23:08.200 --> 00:23:09.440
Young General Wei came to see you.

00:23:09.510 --> 00:23:10.350
He waited,

00:23:10.350 --> 00:23:11.350
then left a letter for you.

00:23:19.110 --> 00:23:20.070
The first one there

00:23:20.070 --> 00:23:21.070
is actually the Crown Prince.

00:23:21.400 --> 00:23:22.440
This time His Highness himself

00:23:22.440 --> 00:23:23.440
will oversee the campaign.

00:23:27.720 --> 00:23:28.590
The Crown Prince is even

00:23:28.590 --> 00:23:29.930
(Li Huan, the Crown Prince)
younger than Yun

00:23:30.240 --> 00:23:31.440
and has no field experience.

00:23:32.250 --> 00:23:33.240
How could His Majesty send him

00:23:33.240 --> 00:23:34.880
(Yao Yong, the State-Supporting General)
as overseer?

00:23:36.030 --> 00:23:37.110
His Majesty's mind

00:23:37.640 --> 00:23:38.880
is not for us to guess.

00:23:39.790 --> 00:23:40.630
No matter.

00:23:41.110 --> 00:23:42.480
We'll just fight the enemy.

00:23:43.550 --> 00:23:44.680
Jun, we are setting out today,

00:23:45.000 --> 00:23:46.070
why is she not here to see you off?

00:23:47.880 --> 00:23:49.440
Today's departure was sudden,

00:23:49.830 --> 00:23:50.920
and earlier than planned.

00:23:52.000 --> 00:23:53.030
I can understand.

00:24:07.960 --> 00:24:09.310
"To Lady Chu:

00:24:09.880 --> 00:24:10.880
I hope this letter

00:24:11.440 --> 00:24:12.480
finds you well.

00:24:14.000 --> 00:24:15.310
I depart today for war.

00:24:15.830 --> 00:24:17.680
Please be at ease.

00:24:18.510 --> 00:24:19.350
I

00:24:19.510 --> 00:24:20.640
never meant to hinder you,

00:24:21.160 --> 00:24:22.070
but the Arsenal Bureau

00:24:22.070 --> 00:24:23.550
is the empire's critical stronghold.

00:24:24.030 --> 00:24:26.510
There are only two ways in.

00:24:28.590 --> 00:24:29.440
Once I return victorious,

00:24:30.110 --> 00:24:31.440
you shall have your answer."

(To Lady Chu)

Linyang.

00:26:28.880 --> 00:26:30.200
It's walnut cookies from Jiqing Pastry.

00:26:30.750 --> 00:26:31.590
They are still warm.

00:26:32.240 --> 00:26:33.080
Try one.

00:26:37.510 --> 00:26:39.240
Still troubled by the

00:26:40.070 --> 00:26:40.910
Arsenal Bureau?

00:26:44.750 --> 00:26:46.030
Wei Jun mentioned it

00:26:46.030 --> 00:26:47.590
in his letter—

00:26:47.830 --> 00:26:49.310
there are only two ways

00:26:49.310 --> 00:26:50.440
to enter:

00:26:51.160 --> 00:26:52.510
a royal decree,

00:26:52.950 --> 00:26:53.790
or

00:26:53.790 --> 00:26:55.590
an official post

00:26:55.590 --> 00:26:56.440
or token of authority.

00:26:56.790 --> 00:26:59.350
We can't hope for a decree

00:26:59.830 --> 00:27:00.830
or appointment,

00:27:02.070 --> 00:27:03.550
but what is that "token"?

00:27:05.310 --> 00:27:06.480
He didn't say.

00:27:08.270 --> 00:27:09.110
Still,

00:27:09.350 --> 00:27:10.680
if he told me this much,

00:27:11.070 --> 00:27:12.480
then once he returns victorious,

00:27:12.480 --> 00:27:13.750
we'll investigate together.

00:27:16.350 --> 00:27:17.190
Linyang.

00:27:18.240 --> 00:27:19.080
Linyang.

00:27:19.750 --> 00:27:20.920
It's cold at night.

00:27:21.070 --> 00:27:22.160
Why are you here instead of

00:27:22.160 --> 00:27:23.240
staying in your room?

00:27:23.720 --> 00:27:24.560
Put this on.

00:27:26.920 --> 00:27:27.920
You're thoughtful, Jin.

00:27:33.440 --> 00:27:34.510
You always think of her first,

00:27:34.510 --> 00:27:35.720
never of me

00:27:36.880 --> 00:27:38.480
when you have something delicious.

00:27:44.350 --> 00:27:45.200
Jin,

00:27:45.200 --> 00:27:46.040
yours has already

00:27:46.200 --> 00:27:47.350
been sent to your room

00:27:47.350 --> 00:27:48.350
by Chu Shan.

00:27:48.960 --> 00:27:49.880
Really?

00:27:49.880 --> 00:27:50.720
Really.

00:27:52.270 --> 00:27:53.270
I knew it.

00:27:53.270 --> 00:27:54.400
Brother always

00:27:54.400 --> 00:27:55.920
thinks of me first.

00:28:00.070 --> 00:28:00.920
What's so funny?

00:28:03.030 --> 00:28:04.310
I heard

00:28:04.750 --> 00:28:05.960
you went to see Wei Jun again.

00:28:07.400 --> 00:28:08.790
You've really gone to great lengths

00:28:09.640 --> 00:28:11.310
for this marriage.

00:28:11.680 --> 00:28:12.520
Jin,

00:28:13.160 --> 00:28:14.400
Yu's contact with Wei Jun

00:28:14.750 --> 00:28:15.790
is not for

00:28:15.790 --> 00:28:16.750
his family status.

00:28:17.000 --> 00:28:18.680
Don't speak with barbs.

00:28:19.160 --> 00:28:20.880
Whether I marry Wei Jun

00:28:21.480 --> 00:28:23.160
or another,

00:28:23.480 --> 00:28:25.030
it will be because I love him,

00:28:25.030 --> 00:28:26.270
not to climb.

00:28:27.830 --> 00:28:28.960
Your confession

00:28:29.640 --> 00:28:31.000
at Spring Breeze house

00:28:31.000 --> 00:28:32.640
was showy and trying to

00:28:32.640 --> 00:28:33.550
draw his attention,

00:28:33.880 --> 00:28:35.200
and now you

00:28:35.200 --> 00:28:36.640
hide behind lofty reasons.

00:28:37.350 --> 00:28:38.590
I did that because

00:28:38.750 --> 00:28:40.240
my nature is what it is.

00:28:40.400 --> 00:28:41.240
While you,

00:28:41.590 --> 00:28:43.440
with your refined airs—

00:28:43.440 --> 00:28:44.290
what's under

00:28:44.300 --> 00:28:45.160
your bed?

00:28:45.270 --> 00:28:46.350
Pai gow, dice,

00:28:46.350 --> 00:28:47.590
and that other thing...

00:28:47.590 --> 00:28:48.430
You went through my stuff!

00:28:49.400 --> 00:28:50.550
You just didn't hide them well.

00:28:51.110 --> 00:28:52.110
Ask around the household,

00:28:52.440 --> 00:28:53.280
everyone knows.

00:28:54.510 --> 00:28:55.350
Stop glaring at me.

00:28:55.350 --> 00:28:56.350
Why stop?

00:28:57.680 --> 00:28:58.830
I won't stop!

00:29:00.070 --> 00:29:00.920
Enough.

00:29:01.200 --> 00:29:02.400
Don't fight.

00:29:02.400 --> 00:29:04.640
Linyang, you needn't intervene.

00:29:06.480 --> 00:29:08.270
- Glare again!
- So what?

00:29:08.270 --> 00:29:09.640
- I dare you!
- Try me!

00:29:09.640 --> 00:29:10.480
You asked for this!

00:29:11.600 --> 00:29:12.440
You dare hit me!

00:29:12.440 --> 00:29:13.750
Come on, catch me.

00:29:14.310 --> 00:29:15.270
- You can't catch me.
- Chu Yu!

00:29:15.400 --> 00:29:16.240
Chu Yu!

00:29:17.110 --> 00:29:17.960
Come on. I'm here.

00:29:18.400 --> 00:29:19.440
- If I catch you,
- You think you can?

00:29:19.440 --> 00:29:20.340
you'll regret this!

00:29:20.340 --> 00:29:22.080
(Chu Mansion)
You can catch me?

00:29:22.110 --> 00:29:23.480
- No way!
- Chu Yu!

00:29:28.100 --> 00:29:31.420
(Wei Encampment)

00:29:31.620 --> 00:29:35.140
(Wei)

00:29:54.480 --> 00:29:55.860
Why did Father suddenly mobilize the army?

00:29:56.350 --> 00:29:57.920
Weren't we only to defend the city?

00:29:58.140 --> 00:29:59.000
Why change

00:29:59.000 --> 00:29:59.840
after only a month?

00:30:00.000 --> 00:30:01.000
Report from the front:

00:30:01.310 --> 00:30:02.840
North Qi forces have retreated to Baidi Valley.

00:30:03.000 --> 00:30:03.960
They're fewer than twenty thousand.

00:30:04.030 --> 00:30:04.950
The Crown Prince ordered us

00:30:04.960 --> 00:30:06.000
to pursue the victory.

00:30:06.000 --> 00:30:07.440
Baidi Valley is a depression.

00:30:07.640 --> 00:30:08.640
Though we have more men,

00:30:08.640 --> 00:30:09.640
it will be a fierce battle.

00:30:10.510 --> 00:30:11.830
Why not plan tactics

00:30:11.830 --> 00:30:12.670
before pursuit?

00:30:14.240 --> 00:30:15.310
It's a military order.

00:30:16.000 --> 00:30:16.840
I...

00:30:21.830 --> 00:30:22.680
Yun,

00:30:22.680 --> 00:30:23.520
don't worry.

00:30:23.720 --> 00:30:25.030
When we return

00:30:25.270 --> 00:30:26.270
we'll teach you

00:30:26.270 --> 00:30:27.200
battlefield craft.

00:30:28.270 --> 00:30:29.110
I...

00:30:29.440 --> 00:30:30.280
Stop that.

00:30:31.550 --> 00:30:32.390
Yun,

00:30:33.160 --> 00:30:34.240
stay and guard the rear.

00:30:34.240 --> 00:30:35.080
When we return

00:30:35.440 --> 00:30:36.350
we'll celebrate, drink,

00:30:36.480 --> 00:30:37.320
and have reunion meals.

00:30:43.110 --> 00:30:43.950
Yun,

00:30:46.350 --> 00:30:47.240
guard the camp well.

00:30:47.880 --> 00:30:48.880
Believe your brothers.

00:30:49.350 --> 00:30:50.240
We will return victorious.

00:31:27.640 --> 00:31:28.480
Jun,

00:31:29.240 --> 00:31:30.080
give the orders.

00:31:31.550 --> 00:31:32.720
Wei soldiers,

00:31:33.310 --> 00:31:34.160
out there today,

00:31:34.880 --> 00:31:36.000
united we fight,

00:31:36.790 --> 00:31:37.960
united we die!

00:31:38.270 --> 00:31:39.400
Protect the nation

00:31:39.680 --> 00:31:41.110
with no regrets!

00:31:41.350 --> 00:31:42.960
Protect the nation

00:31:42.960 --> 00:31:44.350
with no regrets!

00:31:44.590 --> 00:31:45.830
Protect the nation

00:31:46.000 --> 00:31:47.400
with no regrets!

00:31:47.640 --> 00:31:48.960
Protect the nation

00:31:49.160 --> 00:31:50.510
with no regrets!

00:31:50.750 --> 00:31:52.110
Protect the nation

00:31:52.310 --> 00:31:53.640
with no regrets!

00:31:59.550 --> 00:32:00.390
March out!

00:32:31.260 --> 00:32:35.340
(Wei)

00:32:37.300 --> 00:32:38.660
(Sui)

00:32:41.980 --> 00:32:43.540
(Qi)

00:32:51.980 --> 00:32:55.340
(Su Cha, North Qi General)

00:33:04.110 --> 00:33:05.510
Charge!

00:33:05.640 --> 00:33:06.830
Charge!

00:33:07.720 --> 00:33:16.690
Charge! Charge! Charge!

00:33:16.710 --> 00:33:23.400
Charge! Charge! Charge!

00:34:03.960 --> 00:34:04.800
Retreat!

00:34:04.960 --> 00:34:05.800
Retreat!

00:34:12.280 --> 00:34:13.120
Retreat now!

00:34:21.110 --> 00:34:22.000
In this battle, we will

00:34:22.000 --> 00:34:22.960
crush North Qi so thoroughly

00:34:22.960 --> 00:34:24.120
they won't dare attack for ten years.

00:34:24.400 --> 00:34:25.590
I'll take the head of

00:34:25.590 --> 00:34:27.110
North Qi's war god Su Cha.

00:34:35.760 --> 00:34:37.360
What bad luck!

00:34:41.070 --> 00:34:42.030
When we get back

00:34:42.480 --> 00:34:43.630
I'll hire a fortune-teller

00:34:43.630 --> 00:34:44.550
to wipe it out.

00:34:48.960 --> 00:34:49.800
Young General,

00:34:54.510 --> 00:34:56.150
you've been to the front so often.

00:34:56.710 --> 00:34:58.000
Take a break this time.

00:34:58.510 --> 00:34:59.800
How can I rest with enemies to kill?

00:35:01.100 --> 00:35:01.960
I want North Qi to quake

00:35:01.960 --> 00:35:03.070
at the sound of my name,

00:35:03.760 --> 00:35:04.710
earn the greatest merits,

00:35:04.920 --> 00:35:05.840
and hold the highest office,

00:35:06.710 --> 00:35:07.670
even higher than my father.

00:35:08.480 --> 00:35:09.320
Alright, alright.

00:35:18.800 --> 00:35:19.670
At this time,

00:35:21.700 --> 00:35:22.550
they should have been

00:35:22.550 --> 00:35:23.590
entered Baidi Valley.

00:35:27.480 --> 00:35:31.000
Charge!

00:35:58.480 --> 00:35:59.320
Halt!

00:36:32.020 --> 00:36:34.580
(Wei)

00:36:43.420 --> 00:36:44.280
Oh no!

00:36:44.280 --> 00:36:45.120
Ambush!

00:36:45.140 --> 00:36:46.840
Fall back!

00:37:21.840 --> 00:37:22.680
Take cover!

00:38:02.070 --> 00:38:03.510
General, the intelligence was wrong.

00:38:03.670 --> 00:38:05.120
The enemy is far larger than twenty thousand.

00:38:05.920 --> 00:38:07.000
There must be

00:38:07.320 --> 00:38:09.070
a spy who fed false reports.

00:38:11.190 --> 00:38:12.110
Spy again?

00:38:13.760 --> 00:38:17.480
Charge!

00:38:28.400 --> 00:38:30.960
Charge!

00:38:35.440 --> 00:38:36.510
Charge out!

00:38:37.000 --> 00:38:38.700
Charge!

00:38:38.710 --> 00:38:40.840
Charge!

00:39:45.590 --> 00:39:46.430
(An octagonal crossbow?)

00:39:59.960 --> 00:40:00.960
Shu!

00:40:13.280 --> 00:40:15.150
Shu!

00:40:20.030 --> 00:40:21.320
Father!

00:40:27.840 --> 00:40:29.440
