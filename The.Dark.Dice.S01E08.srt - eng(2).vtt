WEBVTT

00:00:01.066 --> 00:00:02.903
Escape Out.

00:00:03.070 --> 00:00:05.647
All players are assigned as inmates

00:00:05.715 --> 00:00:08.099
trying to escape from this amusement park.

00:00:08.620 --> 00:00:09.204
Mark!

00:00:09.370 --> 00:00:10.742
Guys, we need to hurry up and save him.

00:00:10.819 --> 00:00:13.395
Even if we can save him, we still can’t leave this place.

00:00:13.430 --> 00:00:15.105
We need to find the keys and the exits first.

00:00:15.180 --> 00:00:15.752
Oh?

00:00:15.885 --> 00:00:17.011
There’s a parade.

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:18.401
Run! They’re the Keepers!

00:00:19.114 --> 00:00:19.617
Aom?

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:20.402
Run!

00:00:28.715 --> 00:00:31.697
There are currently two captives.

00:00:31.742 --> 00:00:32.297
Aom.

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:39.402
The Psychological Test will now begin.

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:54.700
Mark?

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:56.056
What?

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:57.097
Mark.

00:00:57.510 --> 00:00:58.004
Aom?

00:00:59.380 --> 00:00:59.854
Aom!

00:01:00.871 --> 00:01:01.402
Mark.

00:01:03.105 --> 00:01:03.598
Mark!

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:04.351
Aom.

00:01:04.471 --> 00:01:05.000
Mark.

00:01:05.376 --> 00:01:05.903
Aom.

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:08.204
-Mark. -Aom.

00:01:08.617 --> 00:01:09.077
Aom.

00:01:09.162 --> 00:01:09.696
Mark.

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:11.902
Aom.

00:02:05.228 --> 00:02:06.099
What’s that smoke?

00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:49.982
Aom, no!

00:02:49.990 --> 00:02:50.939
We’re only wasting our time if we keep arguing!

00:02:50.949 --> 00:02:51.600
Run!

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:53.308
I’ll wait for you to come back and save me.

00:02:53.325 --> 00:02:53.940
Aom!

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:01.352
We’ll go on ahead.

00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:05.302
Manus?

00:03:08.651 --> 00:03:09.749
Guys, wait for me.

00:03:17.577 --> 00:03:18.102
Pan?

00:03:20.730 --> 00:03:21.370
I promise.

00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:25.349
Thanks for your sacrifice, Aom.

00:03:39.583 --> 00:03:40.801
Pan, wait for me!

00:04:09.471 --> 00:04:10.050
Mark?

00:04:11.388 --> 00:04:13.502
Thank you for being the decoy, Aom.

00:04:18.343 --> 00:04:20.297
There is no place for you out there.

00:04:20.662 --> 00:04:21.602
Just stay here.

00:04:21.859 --> 00:04:22.798
Stay forever.

00:04:23.488 --> 00:04:24.798
You’ll die here with your foolishness.

00:04:32.650 --> 00:04:33.921
Hold on! Wait for me!

00:04:39.420 --> 00:04:40.002
Pan!

00:04:40.471 --> 00:04:41.100
Run!

00:04:41.792 --> 00:04:43.801
There is no place for you out there.

00:04:44.360 --> 00:04:46.354
Thank you for being the decoy, Aom.

00:04:46.590 --> 00:04:49.802
The only way we can get out is for someone to divert his attention.

00:04:50.376 --> 00:04:51.303
Just stay here.

00:04:51.539 --> 00:04:52.348
Stay forever.

00:04:52.540 --> 00:04:53.702
Thanks for your sacrifice, Aom.

00:04:53.888 --> 00:04:54.671
-Aom! -Let’s go!

00:04:54.690 --> 00:04:56.339
I’ll wait for you to come back and save me.

00:04:58.605 --> 00:04:59.296
Help…

00:05:00.200 --> 00:05:01.422
Please…

00:05:18.231 --> 00:05:19.656
No one is coming to save us.

00:05:26.890 --> 00:05:28.297
You already know

00:05:29.650 --> 00:05:31.604
how selfish people are.

00:05:36.560 --> 00:05:37.946
So I have to accept it now…

00:05:39.930 --> 00:05:41.647
Am I going to be stuck here again?

00:05:44.920 --> 00:05:48.948
There is a way to put an end to this.

00:06:01.570 --> 00:06:02.939
Take this,

00:06:03.790 --> 00:06:04.902
and everything will be over.

00:06:06.660 --> 00:06:08.047
You don’t have to go through it again.

00:06:22.930 --> 00:06:23.682
Just stay here.

00:06:24.108 --> 00:06:24.896
Stay forever.

00:06:25.037 --> 00:06:27.604
-Thanks for your sacrifice, Aom. -Thank you for being the decoy, Aom.

00:06:27.610 --> 00:06:29.457
-There is no place for you out there. -Aom!

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:30.545
Aom!

00:06:31.100 --> 00:06:31.607
Aom!

00:06:35.968 --> 00:06:36.417
Aom!

00:06:38.106 --> 00:06:38.602
Aom!

00:06:42.428 --> 00:06:43.499
Aom, are you alright?

00:06:43.911 --> 00:06:44.602
-Aom. -No!

00:06:44.790 --> 00:06:45.343
No!

00:06:49.211 --> 00:06:49.748
Aom.

00:06:50.820 --> 00:06:51.902
Calm down. It’s just me.

00:06:53.590 --> 00:06:54.401
It’s me, Samut.

00:06:55.628 --> 00:06:56.554
Take a deep breath.

00:06:57.745 --> 00:06:59.703
I promised I wouldn’t leave you behind, didn’t I?

00:07:02.915 --> 00:07:03.801
I’m here to save you.

00:07:07.210 --> 00:07:08.345
Easy. Easy.

00:07:10.550 --> 00:07:11.299
Samut, you jerk!

00:07:13.170 --> 00:07:14.665
You want to take everything from me, don't you?

00:07:14.693 --> 00:07:15.200
Mark.

00:07:15.540 --> 00:07:16.696
I ain’t letting you do that!

00:07:17.281 --> 00:07:17.801
Mark!

00:07:17.870 --> 00:07:18.832
Mark! Get off him!

00:07:20.605 --> 00:07:21.146
Samut.

00:07:22.703 --> 00:07:25.600
You and Aom are working together to leave me behind!

00:07:26.425 --> 00:07:28.140
You were trying to make me take some pill!

00:07:28.670 --> 00:07:29.502
What’s happened to him?

00:07:31.309 --> 00:07:33.404
The smoke in this room causes hallucination.

00:07:34.007 --> 00:07:34.500
Mark.

00:07:35.120 --> 00:07:36.096
I’m here to save you.

00:07:36.265 --> 00:07:37.022
Get it together.

00:07:37.322 --> 00:07:38.783
How are we going to get him out of here?

00:07:40.950 --> 00:07:41.597
Watch out!

00:07:43.324 --> 00:07:44.090
-Mark! -Mark!

00:07:49.896 --> 00:07:50.500
Aom!

00:07:55.270 --> 00:07:55.902
Samut!

00:08:29.770 --> 00:08:30.554
Where’s Samut?

00:08:34.122 --> 00:08:37.177
There are currently two captives.

00:09:01.545 --> 00:09:02.050
Mark.

00:09:06.629 --> 00:09:08.748
The Psychological Test will now begin.

00:09:13.810 --> 00:09:15.724
The smoke in this room causes hallucination.

00:09:25.605 --> 00:09:26.102
Mark.

00:09:30.457 --> 00:09:31.001
Mark.

00:09:35.069 --> 00:09:36.146
What are you thinking?

00:09:48.897 --> 00:09:50.099
This isn’t an exam.

00:09:51.028 --> 00:09:51.896
No need to be so tense.

00:09:54.290 --> 00:09:54.897
What?

00:09:56.037 --> 00:09:57.654
You look like you’re staring at a ghost.

00:10:01.510 --> 00:10:02.195
This isn’t real.

00:10:02.943 --> 00:10:04.179
You’re just an illusion.

00:10:05.020 --> 00:10:05.854
This is impossible.

00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:15.848
You need to learn to accept the truth, Samut.

00:10:17.680 --> 00:10:19.995
Do you realize how long I’ve been sleeping because of you?

00:10:23.517 --> 00:10:25.616
You think you have a right to do what you did...

00:10:26.951 --> 00:10:28.490
because you’re superior, aren’t you?

00:10:31.986 --> 00:10:32.851
Did I strike a nerve?

00:10:34.106 --> 00:10:35.402
You gonna punch me again?

00:10:37.931 --> 00:10:41.001
You know damn well that what happened that day was your fault.

00:10:41.352 --> 00:10:45.133
And you should know nobody wants you around.

00:10:45.152 --> 00:10:45.823
Atom, you jerk!

00:10:46.382 --> 00:10:47.087
Call an ambulance!

00:10:47.108 --> 00:10:48.000
You’re the worst!

00:10:48.100 --> 00:10:50.054
This is exactly why no one wants to be your friend!

00:10:52.533 --> 00:10:54.305
You always act like you’re so much better than everyone.

00:10:58.300 --> 00:10:59.551
That look on your face…

00:11:00.259 --> 00:11:01.294
I take it you’re aware of it.

00:11:02.460 --> 00:11:03.297
How about this?

00:11:05.537 --> 00:11:06.800
I’ll forgive you

00:11:07.844 --> 00:11:08.897
if you take this.

00:11:13.328 --> 00:11:13.995
Take it,

00:11:15.357 --> 00:11:16.499
and everything will be over.

00:11:20.130 --> 00:11:22.097
Nobody wants you around.

00:11:22.727 --> 00:11:24.140
You’re the worst!

00:11:25.139 --> 00:11:26.937
This is exactly why no one wants to be your friend!

00:11:27.920 --> 00:11:28.797
Thank you, Samut.

00:11:31.120 --> 00:11:31.700
No.

00:11:35.600 --> 00:11:36.851
What you said isn’t true.

00:11:38.670 --> 00:11:39.946
None of it is true.

00:11:41.877 --> 00:11:44.500
I know you’re just jealous so you make things up.

00:11:45.914 --> 00:11:47.777
There’s no place for you here.

00:11:48.035 --> 00:11:51.198
What you said then and even now, none of it is true.

00:11:55.360 --> 00:11:56.451
You’re quite good

00:11:57.390 --> 00:11:58.605
for keeping your wits about you.

00:11:59.891 --> 00:12:01.850
I can’t say the same thing about your friend, though.

00:12:11.940 --> 00:12:12.970
Of course, Mom.

00:12:17.802 --> 00:12:18.257
Mark!

00:12:21.774 --> 00:12:22.186
Mark!

00:12:22.702 --> 00:12:23.176
Mark!

00:12:24.339 --> 00:12:24.822
Mark!

00:12:25.420 --> 00:12:25.920
Mark!

00:12:34.342 --> 00:12:35.204
His heart is beating.

00:12:35.817 --> 00:12:36.300
Mark!

00:12:37.290 --> 00:12:38.137
Mark, wake up!

00:12:38.635 --> 00:12:39.137
Mark!

00:12:40.090 --> 00:12:40.797
Mark!

00:12:41.902 --> 00:12:42.537
Mark!

00:12:43.830 --> 00:12:46.201
The captive’s soul has been imprisoned.

00:12:48.970 --> 00:12:49.448
Hey!

00:12:50.008 --> 00:12:50.800
Let me go!

00:12:51.066 --> 00:12:51.696
Help!

00:12:52.170 --> 00:12:53.000
Can you hear me?

00:12:53.432 --> 00:12:54.050
Guys!

00:12:54.160 --> 00:12:54.997
Where are you?

00:12:55.500 --> 00:12:56.694
Time left in the game.

00:13:00.420 --> 00:13:01.899
Can we really get out of here?

00:13:02.850 --> 00:13:03.893
Of course, we can.

00:13:04.448 --> 00:13:06.020
We have the keys now.

00:13:06.510 --> 00:13:08.001
We just need to save Samut.

00:13:08.903 --> 00:13:10.948
You saw what it’s like in there,

00:13:12.291 --> 00:13:13.696
and you still want to go and save him?

00:13:14.417 --> 00:13:16.697
The game isn’t over so this is no time to give up.

00:13:17.845 --> 00:13:21.300
And I believe Samut isn’t going to give up, either.

00:13:23.657 --> 00:13:24.802
I’ll save him at all costs.

00:13:28.512 --> 00:13:30.419
But how will we do that?

00:13:31.605 --> 00:13:33.699
Those Keepers can electrocute us with just one touch.

00:13:37.995 --> 00:13:39.614
Then we take care of them first.

00:13:47.800 --> 00:13:48.238
Run!

00:13:51.669 --> 00:13:52.422
Hey! Over here!

00:13:52.520 --> 00:13:53.552
Come at me! Come on!

00:13:54.840 --> 00:13:55.588
Come here!

00:14:02.300 --> 00:14:02.845
Mark?

00:14:03.594 --> 00:14:04.595
Mark, stay with me.

00:14:04.868 --> 00:14:05.334
Mark.

00:14:05.651 --> 00:14:06.151
Mark.

00:14:06.404 --> 00:14:06.902
Mark.

00:14:08.120 --> 00:14:08.608
Aom?

00:14:09.710 --> 00:14:10.154
Kaen?

00:14:10.260 --> 00:14:10.762
Hurry up.

00:14:10.866 --> 00:14:12.613
Mamay and the rest can only buy us some time.

00:14:12.958 --> 00:14:13.899
Alright. Let’s go.

00:14:20.303 --> 00:14:20.940
Guys!

00:14:21.914 --> 00:14:22.706
Over here!

00:14:29.891 --> 00:14:30.500
Put him down.

00:14:40.170 --> 00:14:40.899
Mark!

00:14:41.195 --> 00:14:42.604
Mark, wake up, please!

00:14:44.029 --> 00:14:44.647
Mark.

00:14:45.312 --> 00:14:46.013
Mark.

00:14:46.499 --> 00:14:47.254
Mark.

00:14:48.241 --> 00:14:48.952
Mark.

00:14:49.980 --> 00:14:51.048
His heart is still beating,

00:14:51.407 --> 00:14:52.503
but he isn’t responsive at all.

00:14:53.274 --> 00:14:55.404
We saw his soul locked up somewhere.

00:14:55.940 --> 00:14:57.497
It could be the prison cell in this amusement park,

00:14:57.557 --> 00:14:58.600
like the game said.

00:15:02.305 --> 00:15:03.699
That means Mark is alive.

00:15:05.310 --> 00:15:07.497
What exactly happened in that room?

00:15:12.940 --> 00:15:13.558
Take it.

00:15:15.939 --> 00:15:16.453
Aom.

00:15:18.560 --> 00:15:20.180
Did you get offered a red pill when you were in that room?

00:15:20.811 --> 00:15:21.401
I did.

00:15:21.680 --> 00:15:23.093
Someone offered it to me.

00:15:23.434 --> 00:15:25.597
It disappeared when you barged in.

00:15:32.900 --> 00:15:34.648
Do you remember what the voice said?

00:15:35.360 --> 00:15:37.051
It said there would be a psychological test.

00:15:38.734 --> 00:15:40.602
I think that red pill is the test.

00:15:41.190 --> 00:15:43.736
I saw Mark take the pill before he passed out.

00:15:45.630 --> 00:15:47.948
His soul must be confined somewhere inside this place.

00:15:49.059 --> 00:15:50.700
But how do we wake him up?

00:16:00.475 --> 00:16:01.801
We can still make a wish.

00:16:04.121 --> 00:16:05.420
If we get out of here,

00:16:06.170 --> 00:16:08.019
we can collect four medals.

00:16:10.595 --> 00:16:12.256
If the game really does grant wishes,

00:16:13.414 --> 00:16:14.801
we can still save Mark.

00:16:15.810 --> 00:16:17.148
Then we need to find all the keys.

00:16:18.210 --> 00:16:20.851
Let’s split into three groups so we can work faster.

00:16:22.500 --> 00:16:24.195
Aom and I will go to the train station zone.

00:16:25.520 --> 00:16:27.268
Mamay and Kaen will go to the miniature city zone.

00:16:28.485 --> 00:16:30.503
Don and Benz, you two take the haunted house zone.

00:16:31.790 --> 00:16:35.002
Pie, stay with Mark to make sure you’re out of the Soul Keepers’ way.

00:16:40.355 --> 00:16:41.470
Dude, stay close.

00:16:41.574 --> 00:16:42.207
Samut.

00:16:49.100 --> 00:16:50.253
Don, I found it!

00:16:52.760 --> 00:16:53.545
That’s our code!

00:17:01.555 --> 00:17:02.020
Hell yeah!

00:17:18.558 --> 00:17:19.902
Did you all get the keys?

00:17:23.733 --> 00:17:25.395
This is the last zone.

00:17:28.103 --> 00:17:29.499
Let’s go, shall we?

00:17:51.315 --> 00:17:52.400
What are these doors?

00:18:14.601 --> 00:18:16.256
These doors must be the exits.

00:18:41.253 --> 00:18:43.699
An exit has been unlocked with a key.

00:19:08.070 --> 00:19:10.050
Two souls detected.

00:19:11.714 --> 00:19:15.777
Only one soul is allowed through each exit.

00:19:17.619 --> 00:19:19.300
So one exit for one person?

00:19:22.244 --> 00:19:24.302
Doesn’t that mean only six people get to leave?

00:19:30.411 --> 00:19:32.500
The game never meant to let all of us go.

00:19:33.130 --> 00:19:34.810
Maybe there are more keys somewhere else?

00:19:34.968 --> 00:19:36.903
Don’t you see there are only six doors?

00:19:37.328 --> 00:19:38.622
Only six people will leave.

00:19:39.230 --> 00:19:41.752
Does that mean someone has to stay behind?

00:19:48.103 --> 00:19:49.401
It ain’t going to be me.

00:19:56.013 --> 00:19:56.650
Guys.

00:19:59.099 --> 00:20:00.600
Will you agree to let Mamay leave first?

00:20:02.346 --> 00:20:03.500
Why her?

00:20:05.840 --> 00:20:07.296
Mamay has three medals right now.

00:20:07.920 --> 00:20:10.050
She has the highest chance of collecting four medals.

00:20:10.510 --> 00:20:12.200
And you would be the next to leave, is that right?

00:20:13.320 --> 00:20:14.697
Since you also have three medals.

00:20:18.890 --> 00:20:20.202
Devious bastard.

00:20:22.980 --> 00:20:27.497
You’re only playing the leader act just so you get the most out of this.

00:20:29.900 --> 00:20:33.096
It’s not Samut’s fault that there are only six doors here.

00:20:35.610 --> 00:20:38.201
We all got here because of his plan.

00:20:43.302 --> 00:20:44.600
Do you have a better idea?

00:20:48.390 --> 00:20:48.896
Don.

00:20:50.000 --> 00:20:51.051
I agree with Samut.

00:20:52.130 --> 00:20:55.656
He saved me from the Soul Keepers and saved our butts all through the game.

00:20:57.198 --> 00:20:58.254
I believe in him.

00:20:59.350 --> 00:21:00.244
I’m okay with his plan.

00:21:01.690 --> 00:21:02.374
Me, too.

00:21:07.149 --> 00:21:08.497
Fine, then.

00:21:16.114 --> 00:21:17.496
This is the best way.

00:21:30.570 --> 00:21:32.897
Now we have five keys and six people.

00:21:33.540 --> 00:21:34.377
What are you gonna do?

00:21:41.940 --> 00:21:42.503
Hold on.

00:21:47.880 --> 00:21:49.151
There’s something I want to try.

00:22:01.182 --> 00:22:02.900
Are these really the exits?

00:22:03.640 --> 00:22:05.703
Samut, are you sure about this?

00:22:12.530 --> 00:22:14.900
An exit has been unlocked with a key.

00:22:23.090 --> 00:22:23.700
Holy crap!

00:22:24.767 --> 00:22:25.800
Mark got through.

00:22:30.511 --> 00:22:31.897
What does that mean?

00:22:33.943 --> 00:22:36.900
Mamay could take Mark with her.

00:22:37.270 --> 00:22:39.848
This means that those whose souls are imprisoned can still leave.

00:22:41.998 --> 00:22:43.302
What are you saying exactly?

00:22:44.840 --> 00:22:46.754
If one of us agrees to have their soul taken away,

00:22:47.840 --> 00:22:49.102
we can all leave.

00:22:54.137 --> 00:22:56.776
We will then use Mamay’s wish to put the souls back into their bodies.

00:22:57.110 --> 00:22:58.648
Who will agree to that?

00:23:04.223 --> 00:23:04.797
I will.

00:23:06.567 --> 00:23:10.700
But in order for that to happen, two people have to be captured.

00:23:12.850 --> 00:23:14.801
I’m asking one of you to come with me.

00:23:25.032 --> 00:23:25.696
I’ll do it.

00:23:28.137 --> 00:23:28.910
Are you sure about this?

00:23:29.220 --> 00:23:31.152
This is no time to be rational.

00:23:31.718 --> 00:23:32.398
Let’s just go.

00:23:42.231 --> 00:23:43.700
There are no Soul Keepers here at all.

00:23:43.890 --> 00:23:44.841
We’ll have to wait.

00:23:56.440 --> 00:23:57.045
Aom.

00:23:57.600 --> 00:23:59.050
Do you still have that handkerchief?

00:24:04.949 --> 00:24:07.598
When the test begins, cover your nose with the handkerchief

00:24:08.150 --> 00:24:09.419
so you don’t inhale the smoke.

00:24:13.520 --> 00:24:16.700
I’ll quickly take that red pill.

00:24:19.010 --> 00:24:19.650
Okay.

00:24:25.899 --> 00:24:27.002
Are you sure you’re alright?

00:24:35.742 --> 00:24:36.248
Aom.

00:24:38.059 --> 00:24:39.062
Can I ask you something?

00:24:44.297 --> 00:24:47.102
Why did you agree to be captured again?

00:24:52.727 --> 00:24:53.700
Earlier…

00:24:55.840 --> 00:24:57.094
Desperation got the better of me.

00:24:58.870 --> 00:25:01.200
I was honestly going to take that red pill.

00:25:04.960 --> 00:25:06.499
But right when I was at my darkest,

00:25:10.140 --> 00:25:12.402
you barged through that door to save me.

00:25:16.136 --> 00:25:17.300
That promise of yours

00:25:19.810 --> 00:25:21.899
made me feel like I could trust again.

00:25:27.428 --> 00:25:28.100
Thank you.

00:25:35.410 --> 00:25:39.503
I hope I can get out of this place with the wish we’re going to make.

00:25:47.048 --> 00:25:47.897
Honestly,

00:25:49.005 --> 00:25:51.201
if you didn’t have to save me and Mark,

00:25:52.635 --> 00:25:53.899
what would your wish be?

00:26:01.635 --> 00:26:03.425
I would wish to turn back time, I guess.

00:26:06.430 --> 00:26:08.302
So I never played this game in the first place.

00:26:11.620 --> 00:26:12.602
That would be too bad.

00:26:14.682 --> 00:26:15.703
What do you mean?

00:26:17.340 --> 00:26:18.654
If that was the case,

00:26:22.671 --> 00:26:23.797
I wouldn’t see you again.

00:26:30.240 --> 00:26:30.800
Samut!

00:26:31.691 --> 00:26:32.654
The Soul Keepers are here.

00:26:59.640 --> 00:27:00.146
Samut.

00:27:01.041 --> 00:27:01.601
Samut!

00:27:03.041 --> 00:27:03.635
Samut.

00:27:04.207 --> 00:27:04.748
Samut.

00:27:11.546 --> 00:27:12.699
Are you alright?

00:27:17.290 --> 00:27:19.247
The Psychological Test will now begin.

00:27:49.223 --> 00:27:49.688
Aom.

00:27:50.874 --> 00:27:52.995
Do you think the game really will give me back my soul?

00:27:54.100 --> 00:27:56.482
If I don’t get out of here, will you please tell my parents...

00:27:56.502 --> 00:27:57.630
You will be alright.

00:27:59.515 --> 00:28:00.497
Believe me.

00:28:09.851 --> 00:28:12.700
I believe in you to save me.

00:28:18.900 --> 00:28:19.453
Samut.

00:28:20.310 --> 00:28:20.816
Aom?

00:28:20.877 --> 00:28:22.103
That promise of yours

00:28:22.672 --> 00:28:24.601
made me feel like I could trust again.

00:28:24.641 --> 00:28:25.191
Samut.

00:28:26.023 --> 00:28:26.579
Samut.

00:28:26.918 --> 00:28:27.494
Samut!

00:28:27.857 --> 00:28:28.794
Aom, where are you?

00:28:28.908 --> 00:28:29.389
Aom.

00:28:30.490 --> 00:28:30.998
Aom.

00:28:32.991 --> 00:28:33.897
Where are you?

00:28:35.234 --> 00:28:35.797
Aom.

00:28:37.105 --> 00:28:38.269
What are you doing, Samut?

00:28:43.727 --> 00:28:44.302
I…

00:28:46.160 --> 00:28:47.377
I thought you…

00:28:47.709 --> 00:28:48.497
What?

00:28:49.250 --> 00:28:51.201
I thought you forgot our plan

00:28:52.740 --> 00:28:54.100
for me to take the pill.

00:28:56.280 --> 00:28:57.051
I see.

00:29:04.546 --> 00:29:05.204
Take it.

00:29:05.930 --> 00:29:07.017
…and everything will be over.

00:29:11.690 --> 00:29:12.771
Where did you get this?

00:29:18.177 --> 00:29:19.299
You’re not Aom.

00:29:21.641 --> 00:29:24.995
I can’t believe you got away twice.

00:29:36.445 --> 00:29:36.928
Aom!

00:29:38.287 --> 00:29:38.752
Aom!

00:29:41.081 --> 00:29:42.149
Aom, spit it out.

00:29:42.402 --> 00:29:42.900
Aom!

00:29:43.462 --> 00:29:43.942
Aom!

00:29:50.746 --> 00:29:51.200
Aom.

00:29:51.960 --> 00:29:52.454
Aom!

00:29:56.194 --> 00:29:57.103
I promise…

00:29:58.899 --> 00:30:00.197
I’ll get you out of here.

00:30:03.000 --> 00:30:03.540
Samut!

00:30:06.281 --> 00:30:06.997
Hurry up!

00:30:10.511 --> 00:30:11.010
Let’s go.

00:30:12.823 --> 00:30:14.087
Samut, the Soul Keepers!

00:30:20.930 --> 00:30:21.638
Hurry up!

00:30:22.180 --> 00:30:22.840
Pie, catch up!

00:30:22.872 --> 00:30:23.490
Hurry up!

00:30:31.230 --> 00:30:32.002
Keep going!

00:30:33.106 --> 00:30:34.148
They’re right behind us.

00:30:40.160 --> 00:30:41.148
We’re almost there.

00:30:48.190 --> 00:30:48.700
Hurry up.

00:30:58.442 --> 00:30:59.051
Hold it!

00:31:02.062 --> 00:31:02.740
Keep pushing!

00:31:03.617 --> 00:31:04.800
Guys, hold the doors!

00:31:11.081 --> 00:31:13.300
Pie, go and unlock every door.

00:31:20.540 --> 00:31:22.850
An exit has been unlocked with a key.

00:31:29.942 --> 00:31:30.745
Got it!

00:31:31.328 --> 00:31:32.097
Go on ahead!

00:31:40.109 --> 00:31:41.302
Kaen, now you go.

00:31:41.510 --> 00:31:42.248
Take Aom with you.

00:31:52.982 --> 00:31:54.000
Keep pushing!

00:31:55.780 --> 00:31:56.253
Push!

00:31:59.370 --> 00:32:00.222
I don’t think we can hold it any longer.

00:32:00.460 --> 00:32:01.071
Let’s just go.

00:32:04.290 --> 00:32:05.958
We’ll run together on my count.

00:32:06.004 --> 00:32:06.509
Right!

00:32:07.505 --> 00:32:08.005
One.

00:32:10.845 --> 00:32:11.361
Two.

00:32:13.437 --> 00:32:13.899
Three.

00:32:36.813 --> 00:32:37.400
Samut!

00:32:50.899 --> 00:32:51.755
Don, my dude!

00:32:52.432 --> 00:32:53.300
We’re alive!

00:32:55.136 --> 00:32:56.152
We made it!

00:32:57.080 --> 00:33:00.100
We all made it out of the game.

00:33:01.900 --> 00:33:02.773
But…

00:33:10.650 --> 00:33:11.505
Game over.

00:33:12.220 --> 00:33:15.251
The inmates have made a successful escape within the time limit.

00:33:15.840 --> 00:33:20.948
The inmates won, and will receive one medal each.

00:33:45.600 --> 00:33:46.200
Samut.

00:33:49.460 --> 00:33:50.954
You should be the one making that wish.

00:34:45.318 --> 00:34:47.697
Player has collected four medals.

00:34:48.390 --> 00:34:50.546
State your desire.

00:34:55.430 --> 00:35:00.398
I wish for the captured souls in the game to come back to these bodies.

00:35:23.970 --> 00:35:26.103
Your wish has been granted.

00:35:28.111 --> 00:35:28.800
Mark.

00:35:29.712 --> 00:35:31.106
Mark is awake, guys!

00:35:34.202 --> 00:35:35.300
Are you alright, Mark?

00:35:36.442 --> 00:35:36.945
Aom.

00:35:38.040 --> 00:35:38.602
Aom.

00:35:45.645 --> 00:35:46.202
Easy.

00:35:46.989 --> 00:35:48.000
Easy, Aom. It’s just me.

00:35:50.700 --> 00:35:51.247
Aom.

00:35:55.590 --> 00:35:56.995
I saved you like I promised.

00:36:11.200 --> 00:36:11.797
Let’s go.

00:36:17.530 --> 00:36:20.300
The game concludes when a wish is granted.

00:36:24.838 --> 00:36:26.651
What does that mean?

00:36:33.685 --> 00:36:34.900
What the hell is going on now?

00:36:37.829 --> 00:36:40.798
Game over.

00:36:41.077 --> 00:36:43.265
Game over.

00:37:04.773 --> 00:37:07.460
We’re back to school, aren’t we?

00:37:13.048 --> 00:37:13.601
Mark?

00:37:15.037 --> 00:37:15.697
Mom!

00:37:23.842 --> 00:37:24.398
Mom.

00:37:28.152 --> 00:37:28.699
Mom.

00:37:33.805 --> 00:37:34.300
Aom.

00:37:35.312 --> 00:37:36.402
Thank you.

00:38:05.857 --> 00:38:08.891
So you’re the only one who got to make a wish.

00:38:14.248 --> 00:38:15.656
Maybe that’s for the best.

00:38:18.430 --> 00:38:20.703
No one has to risk their lives like we did again.

00:38:30.180 --> 00:38:31.352
Let’s go home, then.

00:38:58.330 --> 00:38:59.059
Good luck.

00:39:00.065 --> 00:39:00.696
Bye.

00:39:04.030 --> 00:39:07.968
After the game was over, everything went back to normal.

00:39:12.394 --> 00:39:14.297
It’s like the whole thing never happened.

00:39:17.875 --> 00:39:19.897
But even when it feels as if nothing happened,

00:39:20.838 --> 00:39:23.897
we all know deep down what we went through.

00:39:29.260 --> 00:39:30.362
We learned that…

00:39:30.475 --> 00:39:31.386
We have a quiz this afternoon.

00:39:31.410 --> 00:39:34.628
There are things so minor compared to what we’ve faced.

00:39:34.731 --> 00:39:35.700
Good morning, Samut.

00:39:38.511 --> 00:39:39.062
Here.

00:39:40.740 --> 00:39:42.090
That’s the sheet cheat for Social Studies.

00:39:42.385 --> 00:39:43.386
There’s a quiz this afternoon.

00:39:43.672 --> 00:39:44.334
Wow.

00:39:45.000 --> 00:39:45.749
Thanks.

00:39:48.208 --> 00:39:52.503
We also learned… who we can trust.

00:39:54.370 --> 00:39:56.657
Someone who’s there to push us towards our goals.

00:39:57.108 --> 00:39:57.903
Amazing!

00:39:58.622 --> 00:39:59.970
Well done, bud.

00:40:09.050 --> 00:40:09.751
You tired?

00:40:10.081 --> 00:40:10.600
Exhausted.

00:40:11.188 --> 00:40:12.051
You can do it.

00:40:12.149 --> 00:40:13.900
It’s best for everyone

00:40:16.466 --> 00:40:18.383
now that everything is back to normal.

00:40:22.349 --> 00:40:23.059
…Isn’t it?

00:40:40.920 --> 00:40:41.410
Aom.

00:40:46.560 --> 00:40:47.848
Are you here to enroll?

00:40:50.100 --> 00:40:52.251
There are so many things I have to learn.

00:40:53.330 --> 00:40:55.151
You want me to add ‘going back to school’ to the list?

00:40:57.670 --> 00:40:58.998
How are you adjusting?

00:41:00.170 --> 00:41:01.346
It’s been difficult.

00:41:02.550 --> 00:41:05.945
I didn’t think the outside world would change so much over the years.

00:41:07.800 --> 00:41:08.647
What about you?

00:41:09.087 --> 00:41:10.200
Are you also adjusting?

00:41:12.656 --> 00:41:13.942
To this school?

00:41:15.635 --> 00:41:18.699
To living an unexciting life, unlike in the game.

00:41:24.020 --> 00:41:25.548
What are you asking?

00:41:27.240 --> 00:41:30.417
You said you didn’t want to get involved with that game anymore.

00:41:37.671 --> 00:41:39.611
Aom would say that, wouldn’t she?

00:41:44.370 --> 00:41:45.552
What do you mean?

00:41:48.580 --> 00:41:50.251
You made a wish, didn’t you?

00:41:50.918 --> 00:41:53.105
You wish for the captured souls in the game…

00:41:53.389 --> 00:41:55.099
…to come back to these bodies.

00:41:59.902 --> 00:42:05.600
Did you really think there are only two souls stuck in that game?

00:42:15.850 --> 00:42:20.096
Thanks to you I’m back in this world.

00:42:22.013 --> 00:42:22.890
Who exactly are you?

00:42:32.885 --> 00:42:33.400
Aom.

00:42:35.645 --> 00:42:36.194
Aom!
