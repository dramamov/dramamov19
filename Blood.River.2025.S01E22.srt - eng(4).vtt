00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:44.980
Keep your dirty dealings hidden.

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:47.100
If you expose yourself

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:47.820
in Wushuang City,

00:01:48.870 --> 00:01:50.380
I won't be able to keep you safe.

00:01:56.590 --> 00:01:57.130
I...

00:01:57.510 --> 00:01:57.930
Haoyue,

00:01:58.150 --> 00:01:59.100
mind your manners!

00:02:02.230 --> 00:02:02.920
I, Haoyue,

00:02:03.430 --> 00:02:04.100
offer my greetings, sir.

00:02:08.120 --> 00:02:10.220
So, you're the head of Tianxia House?

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:11.100
Yes,

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:12.060
I am.

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:13.680
I know all about the deals

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:15.220
you made with my foolish disciple.

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:16.780
The reason I didn't interfere

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:18.890
is not because I approved of them,

00:02:19.710 --> 00:02:20.800
but because the matter

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:21.850
was too trivial

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:24.610
to be worth a fuss.

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:32.980
Master...

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:36.260
I know full well that you're useless.

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:38.730
Even though you can't protect

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:39.780
this city with martial skill,

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:42.570
you can still serve it

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:44.820
in other ways.

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:47.240
But don't waste

00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:48.660
what little wit you have

00:02:49.570 --> 00:02:51.690
on greed and profit.

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:53.540
Do you understand?

00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:55.660
Yes, Master.

00:02:57.240 --> 00:02:58.100
Do you still remember

00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:00.610
how you became my disciple?

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:03.060
Of course.

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:05.730
That year, a flood struck my hometown.

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:06.780
Everyone died

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:08.560
except me.

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:09.730
I clung to a tree and survived.

00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:11.760
It was you who passed by and saved me.

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:12.940
Though I

00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:14.290
was slow to learn martial arts,

00:03:14.470 --> 00:03:15.170
you kept me

00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:15.980
by your side,

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:17.220
and I've followed you

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:18.010
ever since.

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:21.450
I know

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:23.500
you grew up in the wild

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:26.450
and never took to life in Wushuang City.

00:03:29.630 --> 00:03:31.380
But I saved your life,

00:03:33.310 --> 00:03:35.100
so you must repay me

00:03:35.690 --> 00:03:36.890
and serve Wushuang City.

00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:38.450
Yes, Master.

00:03:40.870 --> 00:03:41.540
Rise.

00:03:50.870 --> 00:03:51.410
Little Wushuang.

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:52.540
Master.

00:03:53.240 --> 00:03:53.780
Come here.

00:04:00.360 --> 00:04:01.130
From now on,

00:04:02.310 --> 00:04:03.610
you must take good care of your junior brother.

00:04:05.800 --> 00:04:06.290
I've always

00:04:06.710 --> 00:04:07.890
treated him well.

00:04:09.150 --> 00:04:10.260
When he becomes the City Lord,

00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:16.810
you must be loyal to him.

00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:18.850
Yes, Master.

00:04:19.040 --> 00:04:20.250
Serve him with your life.

00:04:21.950 --> 00:04:22.700
I will, Master.

00:04:26.720 --> 00:04:27.290
Send word:

00:04:28.270 --> 00:04:29.660
for the upcoming sword duel,

00:04:30.190 --> 00:04:30.730
Wushuang City

00:04:31.310 --> 00:04:33.050
welcomes heroes from all lands to witness it.

00:04:34.070 --> 00:04:34.780
Have every visitor

00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:36.290
registered by name

00:04:37.070 --> 00:04:38.220
and make this clear to them:

00:04:38.920 --> 00:04:40.050
a sword shows no mercy;

00:04:40.480 --> 00:04:41.900
life or death is their own to bear.

00:04:42.310 --> 00:04:42.930
But

00:04:43.480 --> 00:04:44.460
there's never been

00:04:44.510 --> 00:04:45.220
such a precedent before.

00:04:46.390 --> 00:04:47.100
I know

00:04:48.040 --> 00:04:50.340
they all want to see Wushuang City fall,

00:04:51.430 --> 00:04:52.980
so I will let them come and see.

00:04:53.920 --> 00:04:54.610
They will learn

00:04:55.600 --> 00:04:57.220
soon enough that it will never happen.

00:05:00.210 --> 00:05:01.490
Wushuang City

00:05:02.250 --> 00:05:03.930
may not rival Xueyue City,

00:05:05.240 --> 00:05:05.780
but

00:05:06.800 --> 00:05:08.900
it is not to be taken lightly.

00:05:10.390 --> 00:05:11.340
Not to be

00:05:13.750 --> 00:05:14.290
taken lightly?

00:05:15.270 --> 00:05:15.980
Master!

00:05:17.480 --> 00:05:18.100
Master!

00:05:23.750 --> 00:05:25.140
Why is Master in such a temper today?

00:05:25.510 --> 00:05:26.540
Did he take the wrong medicine?

00:05:29.430 --> 00:05:31.220
Could the City Lord just be bluffing?

00:05:31.950 --> 00:05:32.980
How could he have chosen

00:05:32.980 --> 00:05:34.120
the next City Lord already?

00:05:34.310 --> 00:05:35.050
And it's a child?

00:05:38.490 --> 00:05:39.610
Don't underestimate that child.

00:05:40.070 --> 00:05:41.750
Master is already the finest martial artist

00:05:41.750 --> 00:05:43.220
Wushuang City has seen in generations.

00:05:43.950 --> 00:05:44.620
But that boy's

00:05:44.620 --> 00:05:45.730
gift for swordsmanship

00:05:45.870 --> 00:05:46.850
surpasses even his.

00:05:49.560 --> 00:05:50.170
By contrast,

00:05:50.600 --> 00:05:51.580
I was never suited for martial arts.

00:05:52.160 --> 00:05:54.100
Yes, I am the chief disciple,

00:05:55.360 --> 00:05:56.580
but that title means nothing at all.

00:05:58.630 --> 00:05:59.770
If that child

00:05:59.770 --> 00:06:01.460
really becomes the City Lord,

00:06:01.800 --> 00:06:02.850
then we only need to get rid of him,

00:06:03.310 --> 00:06:04.850
and the whole city will be...

00:06:08.600 --> 00:06:09.370
Useless wretch!

00:06:10.430 --> 00:06:11.730
At least I know I am useless.

00:06:12.190 --> 00:06:13.780
You don't even know your own place.

00:06:14.630 --> 00:06:15.660
People like us

00:06:15.830 --> 00:06:16.720
must rely on the strong.

00:06:16.720 --> 00:06:17.660
We cannot command them.

00:06:18.390 --> 00:06:19.900
We belong in the shadows.

00:06:21.390 --> 00:06:22.850
If you can't even understand that,

00:06:23.430 --> 00:06:24.610
Tianxia House does not need you.

00:06:24.920 --> 00:06:25.370
Understood.

00:06:25.830 --> 00:06:26.340
Understood.

00:06:26.630 --> 00:06:27.290
Useless.

00:06:40.870 --> 00:06:42.460
If even you know we must rely on the strong,

00:06:43.870 --> 00:06:45.050
do you really think I see you as my backer?

00:06:46.630 --> 00:06:47.340
I will wait

00:06:48.430 --> 00:06:49.610
for the day you and Wushuang City

00:06:50.560 --> 00:06:51.340
fall together.

00:06:58.270 --> 00:06:58.980
Master, look!

00:06:59.430 --> 00:07:00.370
It's so lively here!

00:07:01.390 --> 00:07:01.930
Are you happy?

00:07:02.190 --> 00:07:02.780
Yes, I am!

00:07:03.630 --> 00:07:04.220
Little Wushuang,

00:07:05.270 --> 00:07:05.930
what do you

00:07:06.070 --> 00:07:07.250
think of Senior Brother Lu?

00:07:08.270 --> 00:07:10.170
He is a bit slow.

00:07:10.750 --> 00:07:11.410
Indeed.

00:07:11.830 --> 00:07:13.610
He is slow in martial arts.

00:07:14.040 --> 00:07:14.930
But remember,

00:07:15.120 --> 00:07:16.580
everyone has their strengths.

00:07:17.160 --> 00:07:18.410
Though he's not a good fighter,

00:07:18.830 --> 00:07:20.020
he is very smooth

00:07:20.120 --> 00:07:21.050
at getting by in the world.

00:07:21.510 --> 00:07:22.580
In some ways, he even

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:23.660
outshines me.

00:07:24.190 --> 00:07:24.810
Master,

00:07:25.600 --> 00:07:27.250
why are you acting so strangely today?

00:07:27.750 --> 00:07:29.700
Tanghulu!
[*candied fruit]

00:07:30.600 --> 00:07:33.700
Big and sweet tanghulu!

00:07:35.510 --> 00:07:36.020
Master.

00:07:36.040 --> 00:07:36.660
Would you like a stick?

00:07:36.910 --> 00:07:37.530
It'll be one wen.

00:07:38.720 --> 00:07:39.220
Thank you.

00:07:41.430 --> 00:07:42.900
Do you want this one?

00:07:44.390 --> 00:07:44.980
This one?

00:07:46.560 --> 00:07:47.220
Thank you.

00:07:50.480 --> 00:07:51.420
Did you think I acted strangely

00:07:51.420 --> 00:07:52.940
because I didn't buy you

00:07:53.040 --> 00:07:54.050
tanghulu today?

00:07:56.600 --> 00:07:57.140
Here.

00:07:57.830 --> 00:07:58.660
Thank you, Master.

00:08:01.600 --> 00:08:02.700
Though I'm only 30 years old,

00:08:04.920 --> 00:08:06.140
compared to Baili Dongjun and the others,

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:08.540
I'm more like one from their elders' generation.

00:08:11.120 --> 00:08:12.290
I lack their pride

00:08:13.120 --> 00:08:14.580
and their drive.

00:08:16.600 --> 00:08:17.460
That's not how it should be.

00:08:21.390 --> 00:08:22.100
Do you understand?

00:08:33.600 --> 00:08:34.890
If I die one day,

00:08:37.030 --> 00:08:37.980
you must trust

00:08:37.980 --> 00:08:38.820
Senior Brother Lu.

00:08:39.630 --> 00:08:41.010
He may be greedy for small gains,

00:08:41.600 --> 00:08:42.280
but

00:08:42.390 --> 00:08:44.370
he is an honest and kind boy.

00:08:46.320 --> 00:08:47.310
He will take care of you

00:08:47.310 --> 00:08:48.060
just as I have,

00:08:49.440 --> 00:08:50.460
and he'll buy you

00:08:50.460 --> 00:08:51.610
sweet tanghulu too.

00:08:58.840 --> 00:08:59.650
In the days to come,

00:09:00.840 --> 00:09:01.650
if you love sword practice,

00:09:02.150 --> 00:09:03.180
train as much as you wish.

00:09:03.960 --> 00:09:05.530
With your talent,

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:07.610
you can surely become known as a sword deity.

00:09:08.360 --> 00:09:09.730
But if you don't wish to train, that's fine too.

00:09:10.960 --> 00:09:12.370
Travel the world,

00:09:12.960 --> 00:09:13.810
and see

00:09:13.810 --> 00:09:15.250
its mountains and rivers.

00:09:19.240 --> 00:09:20.250
As for me,

00:09:21.200 --> 00:09:22.980
I will not have that chance in this life.

00:09:26.080 --> 00:09:26.850
Master.

00:09:27.360 --> 00:09:28.650
Master, you can't die yet!

00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:29.820
You still have to

00:09:29.840 --> 00:09:30.850
buy me more tanghulu!

00:09:32.870 --> 00:09:33.460
All right.

00:09:35.480 --> 00:09:36.700
I will buy you tanghulu,

00:09:37.910 --> 00:09:39.890
and your senior brother will too.

00:09:40.240 --> 00:09:40.890
All right?

00:09:41.150 --> 00:09:41.820
All right!

00:09:42.720 --> 00:09:43.300
Let's go.

00:09:56.630 --> 00:09:57.130
Miss Bai.

00:09:57.240 --> 00:09:57.770
Mr. Su.

00:09:59.080 --> 00:09:59.610
Mr. Su.

00:09:59.630 --> 00:10:00.250
Miss Bai.

00:10:12.870 --> 00:10:13.370
Mr. Su.

00:10:13.870 --> 00:10:15.060
Mr. Su, please take this tobacco.

00:10:19.550 --> 00:10:20.100
Miss Bai.

00:10:20.910 --> 00:10:21.940
The medicine you prescribed for my mother

00:10:22.030 --> 00:10:22.700
worked wonders.

00:10:23.120 --> 00:10:24.010
She's much better now.

00:10:24.960 --> 00:10:25.980
Don't mention it.

00:10:26.200 --> 00:10:27.300
The clinic is closed today.

00:10:27.480 --> 00:10:28.080
Bring her back

00:10:28.080 --> 00:10:29.530
for a return visit in a few days.

00:10:30.030 --> 00:10:30.580
All right.

00:10:30.790 --> 00:10:32.250
I won't keep you any longer. See you.

00:10:35.550 --> 00:10:36.420
Before we left,

00:10:36.440 --> 00:10:37.580
didn't you tell the maid

00:10:37.670 --> 00:10:38.420
you wouldn't return

00:10:38.550 --> 00:10:40.220
without buying a carriage full of things?

00:10:40.670 --> 00:10:41.700
Why haven't you bought anything?

00:10:42.600 --> 00:10:43.980
Nothing has caught my eye.

00:10:53.240 --> 00:10:53.730
Sir.

00:10:54.030 --> 00:10:54.650
Coming!

00:10:56.630 --> 00:10:57.220
It's you, Miss Bai.

00:10:57.910 --> 00:10:58.490
What would you like?

00:10:59.390 --> 00:11:00.770
A pot of Longjing tea

00:11:01.120 --> 00:11:01.770
and a plate of mung bean cakes.

00:11:02.150 --> 00:11:02.820
Coming right up.

00:11:04.600 --> 00:11:05.060
Waiter,

00:11:05.240 --> 00:11:05.820
bring the tea.

00:11:13.240 --> 00:11:13.770
Here, Miss Bai.

00:11:14.120 --> 00:11:15.530
Our finest tea

00:11:15.790 --> 00:11:16.650
and freshly baked mung bean cakes.

00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:17.610
Please enjoy.

00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:28.730
What's wrong, Miss Bai?

00:11:29.120 --> 00:11:30.650
Is our tea or our dessert

00:11:30.840 --> 00:11:31.370
not to your liking?

00:11:32.510 --> 00:11:33.250
It's not that.

00:11:33.440 --> 00:11:34.460
It's just me.

00:11:35.320 --> 00:11:36.130
I set out today

00:11:36.240 --> 00:11:37.890
hoping for a pleasant outing.

00:11:38.150 --> 00:11:39.340
I felt cheerful at first,

00:11:39.720 --> 00:11:40.940
but after walking half the day,

00:11:41.200 --> 00:11:42.340
everything felt dull.

00:11:42.870 --> 00:11:44.340
But Nan'an City is famous far and wide

00:11:44.510 --> 00:11:45.250
for its curious

00:11:45.360 --> 00:11:46.340
and delightful trinkets.

00:11:48.150 --> 00:11:49.700
That said, you've been here

00:11:49.720 --> 00:11:50.530
for some time now.

00:11:50.870 --> 00:11:51.940
Even the most exciting place

00:11:52.030 --> 00:11:52.940
grows dull

00:11:53.360 --> 00:11:54.370
after a while,

00:11:54.550 --> 00:11:55.220
don't you think?

00:11:55.960 --> 00:11:56.650
Maybe

00:11:56.840 --> 00:11:58.220
you can try seeing it as your home.

00:11:58.630 --> 00:11:59.130
Then

00:11:59.390 --> 00:12:00.820
you may view

00:12:00.870 --> 00:12:02.100
this city differently

00:12:02.390 --> 00:12:03.220
and feel different about it.

00:12:05.840 --> 00:12:06.820
That makes sense.

00:12:08.240 --> 00:12:09.300
But maybe I should travel farther

00:12:09.300 --> 00:12:10.490
and see more of the world.

00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:13.370
That might be a good idea.

00:12:14.670 --> 00:12:15.460
Please enjoy.

00:12:17.720 --> 00:12:18.820
You find it boring

00:12:19.390 --> 00:12:20.500
because you think

00:12:20.500 --> 00:12:21.940
the person beside you is boring.

00:12:22.910 --> 00:12:23.610
Just eat your food.

00:12:28.270 --> 00:12:28.890
Have you heard?

00:12:29.390 --> 00:12:30.010
Something big

00:12:30.120 --> 00:12:31.130
happened recently.

00:12:31.670 --> 00:12:32.370
What big thing?

00:12:33.750 --> 00:12:35.370
Do you mean the orphan from No-Sword City,

00:12:35.550 --> 00:12:36.180
Zhuo Yue'an,

00:12:36.240 --> 00:12:37.100
challenging Wushuang City?

00:12:37.320 --> 00:12:37.890
That's right.

00:12:38.440 --> 00:12:39.370
I heard he defeated

00:12:39.600 --> 00:12:40.300
several elders

00:12:40.600 --> 00:12:41.700
and even the old City Lord.

00:12:42.030 --> 00:12:42.530
Father,

00:12:42.840 --> 00:12:43.300
did you hear that?

00:12:43.630 --> 00:12:45.060
It sounds like they're talking about Su Muyu.

00:12:45.910 --> 00:12:46.490
Be quiet.

00:12:46.910 --> 00:12:48.110
Let me hear how Su Muyu is doing.

00:12:48.110 --> 00:12:48.850
Everyone's talking about it.

00:12:50.750 --> 00:12:52.340
This news has probably spread

00:12:52.390 --> 00:12:53.300
throughout the martial world.

00:12:59.360 --> 00:12:59.770
Sir,

00:13:00.080 --> 00:13:00.580
check, please.

00:13:01.390 --> 00:13:01.980
Take care.

00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:02.570
Please.

00:13:07.600 --> 00:13:08.680
You can rest easy now.

00:13:08.790 --> 00:13:10.890
He came out of his duels in Wushuang City unscathed.

00:13:12.360 --> 00:13:13.940
He'll probably be back

00:13:14.360 --> 00:13:15.420
in a few days.

00:13:19.670 --> 00:13:20.220
Father!

00:13:21.790 --> 00:13:22.820
Don't be rash.

00:13:23.270 --> 00:13:24.770
How many days will it take to reach Wushuang City?

00:13:26.480 --> 00:13:27.060
Half a month.

00:13:27.750 --> 00:13:29.650
If you run into storms

00:13:30.240 --> 00:13:31.610
or snow,

00:13:31.960 --> 00:13:33.060
it could take at least a month.

00:13:36.630 --> 00:13:38.130
What if I ride hard and change horses

00:13:38.270 --> 00:13:39.060
along the way?

00:13:41.080 --> 00:13:42.340
It will take at least seven days.

00:13:42.630 --> 00:13:43.610
Heading to Wushuang City?

00:13:44.120 --> 00:13:45.730
There's a ship docked at the east pier today.

00:13:46.550 --> 00:13:47.700
It will sail east and reach

00:13:47.870 --> 00:13:49.010
Luoyang tomorrow.

00:13:49.270 --> 00:13:50.460
From Luoyang, Wushuang City

00:13:50.550 --> 00:13:51.250
is only 100 li away.

00:13:54.150 --> 00:13:54.700
Mind your own business!

00:14:02.670 --> 00:14:03.250
Master Ji,

00:14:03.750 --> 00:14:04.890
the news has already spread.

00:14:05.720 --> 00:14:07.340
Except for Zhao Yuzhen, the Profound Sword Deity,

00:14:07.840 --> 00:14:08.650
all the other sword deities

00:14:08.790 --> 00:14:10.340
will go to Wushuang City.

00:14:12.030 --> 00:14:13.010
Do you really need

00:14:13.320 --> 00:14:14.570
to come report something like that

00:14:14.570 --> 00:14:15.650
to me in person?

00:14:16.630 --> 00:14:17.650
There is another piece of news.

00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:18.820
It is related to the rule

00:14:18.870 --> 00:14:19.940
you set before.

00:14:25.240 --> 00:14:26.180
Blood River's Spider Woman

00:14:26.600 --> 00:14:27.700
has been hiring agents

00:14:28.240 --> 00:14:29.220
to search for a certain person.

00:14:31.080 --> 00:14:32.530
She's looking for Lianyue, isn't she?

00:14:35.200 --> 00:14:37.100
He has been missing for quite some time.

00:14:37.630 --> 00:14:38.880
Since he visited the Tang Clan,

00:14:39.360 --> 00:14:40.940
there's been no word from him.

00:14:41.360 --> 00:14:42.660
Most of our agents in Shuzhong

00:14:42.910 --> 00:14:43.960
have also been discovered

00:14:43.960 --> 00:14:44.930
by the Tang Clan.

00:14:45.790 --> 00:14:46.540
Since that's the case,

00:14:47.200 --> 00:14:49.090
let's see

00:14:49.150 --> 00:14:50.900
whether this beauty from Blood River

00:14:51.120 --> 00:14:52.500
will make a move

00:14:52.910 --> 00:14:53.540
and what

00:14:53.790 --> 00:14:54.420
new information

00:14:54.440 --> 00:14:55.660
she might bring us.

00:14:56.150 --> 00:14:56.810
But

00:14:56.960 --> 00:14:58.970
our own people must not relax.

00:14:59.150 --> 00:15:00.380
Keep investigating.

00:15:01.320 --> 00:15:02.140
Then should I give her

00:15:02.550 --> 00:15:03.780
information about the Xuanwu Guardian?

00:15:07.510 --> 00:15:09.140
Give it to her if she asks for it.

00:15:09.670 --> 00:15:10.330
Remember,

00:15:10.550 --> 00:15:11.450
take no payment.

00:15:13.360 --> 00:15:13.970

[Tianxia House]

00:15:43.480 --> 00:15:44.300
It seems

00:15:44.630 --> 00:15:45.690
not many people have faith

00:15:45.960 --> 00:15:46.610
in our City Lord.

00:15:51.630 --> 00:15:52.580
- This is mine. - Song Yanhui can split

00:15:52.580 --> 00:15:53.250
a droplet with his sword.

00:15:53.250 --> 00:15:54.450
Do you realize how good he is?

00:15:54.840 --> 00:15:55.660
I'm betting on Song Yanhui!

00:15:55.960 --> 00:15:57.500
[Song Yanhui]
No-Sword City has long been in decline.

00:15:57.630 --> 00:15:58.920
This orphan came out of nowhere.

00:15:58.920 --> 00:16:00.140
[Zhuo Yue'an]
How could he possibly beat Song Yanhui?

00:16:00.250 --> 00:16:01.140
Not a chance!

00:16:01.270 --> 00:16:02.300
What do you mean by that?

00:16:02.550 --> 00:16:03.690
Age brings wisdom!

00:16:03.720 --> 00:16:04.610
Even the previous old City Lord

00:16:04.720 --> 00:16:05.780
was wounded by him.

00:16:06.360 --> 00:16:06.850
Really?

00:16:06.850 --> 00:16:07.900
You can tell he's no ordinary man.

00:16:10.320 --> 00:16:11.300
What is he doing here?

00:16:19.870 --> 00:16:21.850
Sir, I haven't seen you before.

00:16:21.960 --> 00:16:23.300
Is this your first time

00:16:23.360 --> 00:16:24.810
at Tianxia House?

00:16:26.870 --> 00:16:28.210
I suppose it's my second time.

00:16:34.150 --> 00:16:35.260
Pardon my poor eyesight.

00:16:35.600 --> 00:16:36.900
What brings you here this time?

00:16:37.630 --> 00:16:38.810
Poor eyesight?

00:16:39.600 --> 00:16:40.570
Sir,

00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:42.260
these people

00:16:42.600 --> 00:16:44.060
have noses like hounds.

00:16:44.360 --> 00:16:45.200
As soon as someone

00:16:45.200 --> 00:16:46.810
with even a hint of money walks in,

00:16:46.870 --> 00:16:47.660
they'll act

00:16:47.750 --> 00:16:49.020
like they've found their prey.

00:16:49.240 --> 00:16:50.900
They'll fix on that person,

00:16:51.360 --> 00:16:52.780
and within two hours,

00:16:52.960 --> 00:16:54.850
they'll have uncovered his identity, his background,

00:16:55.120 --> 00:16:56.140
and exactly how much

00:16:56.200 --> 00:16:58.210
he can afford to lose.

00:16:58.320 --> 00:16:59.970
Then they'll plan carefully

00:17:00.670 --> 00:17:02.660
to drain every coin from him

00:17:03.000 --> 00:17:04.700
before he leaves Tianxia House,

down to the last scrap of his wealth.

Isn't this

00:17:08.830 --> 00:17:10.570
how you all cheated me

00:17:10.680 --> 00:17:11.810
out of everything back then?

00:17:34.720 --> 00:17:35.650
all this means.

00:17:37.350 --> 00:17:38.130
Ah,

00:17:38.480 --> 00:17:39.540
it's

00:17:39.550 --> 00:17:41.570
about a major event in the martial world.

00:17:42.240 --> 00:17:44.170
Zhuo Yue'an, an orphan from No-Sword City,

00:17:44.440 --> 00:17:46.650
is challenging Song Yanhui,

00:17:46.830 --> 00:17:47.780
the Lord of Wushuang City.

00:17:48.960 --> 00:17:50.890
You can bet on Zhuo Yue'an to win

00:17:51.270 --> 00:17:52.220
at odds of one to one.

00:17:52.680 --> 00:17:53.890
If you wager 100 liang

00:17:54.310 --> 00:17:55.220
and he wins,

00:17:55.510 --> 00:17:57.260
you'll get 200 liang.

00:17:58.240 --> 00:18:00.300
You can also bet on Song Yanhui to win.

00:18:01.030 --> 00:18:02.090
If he does,

00:18:02.440 --> 00:18:03.220
100 liang

00:18:03.350 --> 00:18:05.020
will get you 300 liang.

00:18:05.880 --> 00:18:06.410
Of course,

00:18:06.720 --> 00:18:08.300
you can also bet

00:18:08.440 --> 00:18:09.460
on a draw.

00:18:10.480 --> 00:18:11.650
If you guess right,

00:18:11.960 --> 00:18:13.610
you'll get 200 liang.

00:18:16.440 --> 00:18:17.780
Why does Song Yanhui's win

00:18:18.590 --> 00:18:19.740
pay more?

00:18:21.060 --> 00:18:21.850
Young man,

00:18:21.850 --> 00:18:23.410
you are too naive and clueless.

00:18:23.470 --> 00:18:25.220
You'd best go home now.

00:18:25.300 --> 00:18:26.200
This casino

00:18:26.270 --> 00:18:27.460
is no place

00:18:27.460 --> 00:18:28.370
for lambs like you.

00:18:28.400 --> 00:18:29.010
You...!

00:18:31.590 --> 00:18:32.260
Sir,

00:18:32.510 --> 00:18:33.260
it's because

00:18:33.720 --> 00:18:34.740
fewer people

00:18:34.960 --> 00:18:37.460
are betting on him.

00:18:37.590 --> 00:18:40.540
After all, the former Lord of Wushuang City

00:18:40.720 --> 00:18:42.240
was already defeated

00:18:42.240 --> 00:18:43.810
by Zhuo Yue'an,

00:18:44.110 --> 00:18:45.960
and Song Yanhui's reputation

00:18:45.960 --> 00:18:47.320
isn't much bigger

00:18:47.520 --> 00:18:49.360
than Liu Yunqi's.

00:18:51.350 --> 00:18:52.520
I see.

00:18:53.680 --> 00:18:54.300
But

00:18:54.400 --> 00:18:55.410
more importantly,

00:18:55.790 --> 00:18:57.890
everyone loves a good story.

00:18:58.590 --> 00:19:01.570
From a sect nearly forgotten by the world

00:19:02.070 --> 00:19:06.130
emerges a swordsman unknown to all.

00:19:06.510 --> 00:19:09.020
He defeats the chief disciple of Wushuang City,

00:19:09.310 --> 00:19:11.500
the Four Swordsman of Lunwu Hall,

00:19:12.000 --> 00:19:14.080
Elder Jian Shanyue,

00:19:14.310 --> 00:19:17.300
and the former City Lord, Liu Yunqi.

00:19:18.030 --> 00:19:19.580
Isn't that

00:19:19.580 --> 00:19:21.220
an inspiring tale?

00:19:22.030 --> 00:19:22.980
And if he

00:19:22.980 --> 00:19:25.780
goes on to defeat the current City Lord,

00:19:25.840 --> 00:19:26.930
Song Yanhui,

00:19:27.720 --> 00:19:28.940
won't that make

00:19:29.400 --> 00:19:30.810
the perfect ending?

00:19:36.880 --> 00:19:37.740
How does one place a bet?

00:19:39.070 --> 00:19:42.060
The minimum bet is three liang of silver,

00:19:42.550 --> 00:19:45.220
and the maximum is an entire city.

00:19:46.750 --> 00:19:47.330
All right,

00:19:48.070 --> 00:19:49.260
then I'll bet three liang of silver.

00:19:51.350 --> 00:19:52.780
After all that talk,

00:19:53.110 --> 00:19:55.540
you're only betting three liang?

00:20:00.440 --> 00:20:02.060
Then who are you betting on?

00:20:05.340 --> 00:20:08.100
[Zhuo Yue'an]

00:20:09.640 --> 00:20:10.410
Myself.

00:20:11.310 --> 00:20:12.060
I'll bet on him.

00:20:12.400 --> 00:20:13.260
Really?

00:20:14.000 --> 00:20:15.260
I've never heard of him before.

00:20:18.270 --> 00:20:19.780
I've trained in swordsmanship for years,

00:20:19.880 --> 00:20:20.890
and I'm still no match for Song Yanhui.

00:20:21.070 --> 00:20:22.020
The old City Lord is already formidable,

00:20:22.240 --> 00:20:22.810
so this Zhuo Yue'an

00:20:22.920 --> 00:20:23.410
must be even greater.

00:20:23.550 --> 00:20:24.650
Fine, I'll bet on him then.

00:20:40.750 --> 00:20:42.460
He knew I was watching him all along.

00:20:45.590 --> 00:20:46.260
No,

00:20:47.590 --> 00:20:48.780
not only that.

00:20:50.350 --> 00:20:51.650
He also recognized me.

00:21:00.270 --> 00:21:01.370
You made the right choice.

00:21:05.030 --> 00:21:05.650
Take it.

00:21:08.550 --> 00:21:09.890
Master Ji specifically instructed

00:21:10.160 --> 00:21:11.410
that this lead be given free of charge.

00:21:12.110 --> 00:21:13.410
But it's top secret.

00:21:13.550 --> 00:21:14.570
You mustn't share it with anyone.

00:21:17.960 --> 00:21:19.220
Would your master really be so generous?

[No new leads]

What does this mean?

So your lead is

00:21:30.270 --> 00:21:31.200
that even you

00:21:31.200 --> 00:21:32.410
have no new leads on Tang Lianyue?

00:21:35.640 --> 00:21:36.940
And you call yourselves all-knowing under heaven?

Yes, sir.

is a city that never sleeps.

Night has fallen,

yet it's getting even livelier.

Naturally.

Our main city

is Wushuang City.

Its first City Lord

helped Emperor Tianwu found his empire

00:22:31.750 --> 00:22:32.330
and was granted

great autonomy.

has never had a curfew.

All right.

for someone who passed away?

00:26:17.480 --> 00:26:19.130
You look so serious all of a sudden.

00:26:19.480 --> 00:26:21.610
Is there something wrong with Sihuai City?

00:26:26.070 --> 00:26:27.220
If there really is a problem,

00:26:27.750 --> 00:26:28.500
then it's

00:26:29.790 --> 00:26:30.700
a grave one.

People who come to Sihuai City

00:26:33.790 --> 00:26:35.500
always act in ways I can't make sense of.

00:26:36.550 --> 00:26:38.500
But since you've been generous with your silver,

00:26:38.590 --> 00:26:39.370
I'll

00:26:39.640 --> 00:26:41.330
wait here a while longer.

00:26:46.400 --> 00:26:47.500
Take this pill.

00:26:47.510 --> 00:26:48.480
Then drive the carriage

00:26:48.480 --> 00:26:49.500
and leave at once.

00:26:49.590 --> 00:26:51.260
- What? - You and I have shared

00:26:51.310 --> 00:26:52.220
a journey together.

00:26:52.640 --> 00:26:54.540
I don't wish to see you die here.

00:26:55.070 --> 00:26:56.220
If you can't get out of the city,

00:26:56.310 --> 00:26:57.300
find a safe place

00:26:57.350 --> 00:26:58.020
to hide.

00:26:58.880 --> 00:26:59.540
Huh?

00:27:00.030 --> 00:27:01.220
Do as she says,

00:27:01.680 --> 00:27:03.570
and you'll live.

00:27:05.070 --> 00:27:05.740
Yes.

00:27:07.000 --> 00:27:08.020
I understand, madam.

00:27:20.350 --> 00:27:21.410
What exactly has gone wrong?

00:27:21.920 --> 00:27:22.780
This city

00:27:23.070 --> 00:27:24.220
has been poisoned.

00:27:24.550 --> 00:27:25.370
Poisoned?

00:27:26.640 --> 00:27:27.540
This entire city?

00:27:28.310 --> 00:27:30.090
What kind of poison could be so powerful?

00:27:32.640 --> 00:27:33.570
It's Blossom Ash.

00:27:35.400 --> 00:27:36.890
Its toxicity is mild,

00:27:37.200 --> 00:27:39.020
but if one stays long in air

00:27:39.020 --> 00:27:40.370
tainted with Blossom Ash,

00:27:40.790 --> 00:27:41.780
an ordinary person

00:27:41.830 --> 00:27:43.090
will fall unconscious,

00:27:43.440 --> 00:27:44.540
while a martial artist

00:27:44.640 --> 00:27:45.810
will temporarily lose inner force

00:27:45.830 --> 00:27:47.020
and be as good as crippled.

00:27:47.640 --> 00:27:48.810
Blossom Ash

00:27:49.110 --> 00:27:50.300
spreads widely,

00:27:50.400 --> 00:27:51.980
but to poison an entire city

00:27:52.240 --> 00:27:53.330
takes years of preparation.

00:27:54.200 --> 00:27:55.650
When we first entered the city,

00:27:55.960 --> 00:27:56.700
I did not smell

00:27:56.720 --> 00:27:57.740
its scent.

00:27:58.070 --> 00:27:59.220
Now, halfway through our route,

00:27:59.680 --> 00:28:01.170
it's everywhere.

00:28:01.960 --> 00:28:03.370
All those years of planning

00:28:03.960 --> 00:28:04.810
were leading to this day.

00:28:07.070 --> 00:28:08.060
Sihuai City is

00:28:08.400 --> 00:28:09.260
about to change.

00:28:11.790 --> 00:28:12.500
You're wrong.

00:28:13.880 --> 00:28:14.610
Wushuang City

00:28:15.070 --> 00:28:17.700
houses only smiths and sect disciples.

00:28:18.030 --> 00:28:19.060
Most people

00:28:19.440 --> 00:28:21.300
live in Sihuai City.

00:28:22.440 --> 00:28:23.780
To seize Wushuang,

00:28:24.550 --> 00:28:26.170
one must first take Sihuai.

00:28:26.550 --> 00:28:27.260
So,

00:28:27.750 --> 00:28:29.940
it is Wushuang City that faces the real upheaval.

00:28:32.510 --> 00:28:33.170
Father,

00:28:33.830 --> 00:28:34.610
is there any way you can

00:28:34.750 --> 00:28:36.130
find Su Muyu quickly?

00:28:37.110 --> 00:28:37.780
No problem.

00:28:48.590 --> 00:28:49.980
There are others from Blood River here?

00:28:50.510 --> 00:28:51.460
Could it be...?

00:28:51.640 --> 00:28:53.220
Didn't you say only you came?

00:28:54.510 --> 00:28:56.330
I said I came alone from Blood River,

00:28:56.480 --> 00:28:57.310
but as for those in Nan'an City,

00:28:57.310 --> 00:28:58.130
I can't be sure.

00:28:58.960 --> 00:29:00.020
Find a deserted place

00:29:00.350 --> 00:29:01.460
and meet up with them.

00:29:14.110 --> 00:29:15.940
Will taking this make me all right?

00:29:16.680 --> 00:29:18.020
It will only ease the effects for now.

00:29:18.750 --> 00:29:19.650
The scent of Blossom Ash

00:29:19.720 --> 00:29:20.540
is getting stronger.

00:29:20.880 --> 00:29:22.370
We need to find a place

00:29:22.510 --> 00:29:24.090
where I can set up an Array of Death in Thirty Feet

00:29:24.550 --> 00:29:26.890
to block out the poison.

00:29:27.960 --> 00:29:28.610
All right.

00:29:33.160 --> 00:29:33.810
Let's go.

00:29:52.110 --> 00:29:53.090
Someone's poisoned the city.

00:29:55.790 --> 00:29:56.540
Who could it be?

00:29:59.480 --> 00:30:00.850
Why is it so quiet today?

00:30:03.430 --> 00:30:04.340
You find that strange?

00:30:05.810 --> 00:30:06.680
Sihuai City

00:30:06.680 --> 00:30:08.090
has never had a curfew.

00:30:08.750 --> 00:30:10.500
It's the most famous sleepless city around.

00:30:12.640 --> 00:30:13.570
Interesting.

00:30:14.440 --> 00:30:15.570
There should be more people

00:30:15.590 --> 00:30:17.060
from the martial world here recently.

00:30:43.110 --> 00:30:44.410
What's happening?

00:30:44.510 --> 00:30:45.130
Don't go.

00:30:46.720 --> 00:30:47.460
Sir...

00:31:03.110 --> 00:31:04.300
Blossom Ash.

00:31:19.740 --> 00:31:21.180
[Floral Poison: Blossom Ash]

00:31:26.030 --> 00:31:26.780
Sir,

00:31:27.110 --> 00:31:28.370
at a time like this,

00:31:28.510 --> 00:31:30.170
you still have the heart to read?

00:31:30.720 --> 00:31:31.980
I need to find a way

00:31:32.350 --> 00:31:33.810
to break the Blossom Ash Array.

00:31:33.960 --> 00:31:35.090
Isn't it a bit late

00:31:35.160 --> 00:31:36.610
to start reading now?

00:31:37.960 --> 00:31:38.700
No, it's not.

00:31:38.960 --> 00:31:40.500
Not until the flame of this candle

00:31:40.720 --> 00:31:41.890
burns out completely.

00:32:07.110 --> 00:32:08.410
Did they really think they could

00:32:08.750 --> 00:32:09.890
harm me with such a petty trick?

00:32:21.590 --> 00:32:22.890
Sihuai City has been sealed off.

00:32:23.480 --> 00:32:24.650
Did you know about this?

00:32:26.880 --> 00:32:27.610
Master,

00:32:28.000 --> 00:32:29.260
this has nothing to do with me.

00:32:30.720 --> 00:32:31.890
I know it doesn't.

00:32:33.680 --> 00:32:35.170
You're bold,

00:32:36.070 --> 00:32:37.330
but not that bold.

00:32:39.790 --> 00:32:40.780
Who did it?

00:32:42.510 --> 00:32:43.170
I don't know.

00:32:44.350 --> 00:32:46.300
I received two carrier pigeons,

00:32:46.310 --> 00:32:47.370
both sent in haste.

00:32:48.070 --> 00:32:49.350
One message said

00:32:49.350 --> 00:32:50.540
someone was hunting for Zhuo Yue'an

00:32:50.540 --> 00:32:51.570
in Wushuang City's name,

00:32:51.750 --> 00:32:53.220
which was clearly an attempt to smear

00:32:53.220 --> 00:32:54.500
both the city and you, Master.

00:32:55.200 --> 00:32:56.330
The other said

00:32:56.920 --> 00:32:58.130
a strange poison had appeared in Sihuai.

00:32:58.200 --> 00:32:59.540
Ordinary people have fallen unconscious,

00:33:00.030 --> 00:33:00.850
while martial artists

00:33:00.880 --> 00:33:01.780
have lost their inner force.

00:33:01.830 --> 00:33:02.980
They can't summon any strength at all

00:33:03.510 --> 00:33:05.090
and can only send word through carrier pigeons.

00:33:07.350 --> 00:33:08.460
Blossom Ash?

00:33:10.070 --> 00:33:11.370
Summon Jian Shanyue.

00:33:14.830 --> 00:33:15.650
Elder Jian

00:33:16.960 --> 00:33:18.170
has announced his retirement.

00:33:21.750 --> 00:33:22.810
The one truly in charge of Lunwu Hall

00:33:23.030 --> 00:33:24.260
was never Jian Shanyue,

00:33:24.750 --> 00:33:25.700
but Jian Wudi.

00:33:26.830 --> 00:33:28.460
Jian Wudi has been in seclusion for years,

00:33:28.920 --> 00:33:30.260
so he handed most of his authority

00:33:30.640 --> 00:33:31.850
to Jian Shanyue.

00:33:32.310 --> 00:33:34.020
But Jian Wudi's place of seclusion

00:33:34.310 --> 00:33:35.500
is not in Wushuang City.

00:33:35.920 --> 00:33:36.540
It's

00:33:37.880 --> 00:33:38.980
in Sihuai City.

00:33:40.960 --> 00:33:41.540
Master,

00:33:41.750 --> 00:33:42.850
what should we do?

00:33:43.920 --> 00:33:45.460
I'll go to Sihuai City myself.

00:33:48.310 --> 00:33:49.060
Master,

00:33:49.240 --> 00:33:50.330
let me go with you!

00:33:52.030 --> 00:33:53.980
Jian Wudi has been in seclusion for many years.

00:33:54.550 --> 00:33:56.540
If Lunwu Hall is trying to extend its reach into Sihuai City,

00:33:56.790 --> 00:33:57.890
it won't be easy.

00:33:59.240 --> 00:34:00.130
Tianxia House

00:34:01.160 --> 00:34:02.700
is involved in this, isn't it?

00:34:10.230 --> 00:34:11.290
My dear disciple,

00:34:11.960 --> 00:34:14.340
you thought Tianxia House was loyal to you,

00:34:14.840 --> 00:34:16.060
but it seems they had

00:34:16.440 --> 00:34:17.820
other plans all along.

00:34:20.920 --> 00:34:22.030
I'll go find Lord Haoyue

00:34:22.030 --> 00:34:22.770
and get some answers.

00:34:30.760 --> 00:34:31.690
If this spear

00:34:32.190 --> 00:34:33.940
were thrust into my back,

00:34:35.280 --> 00:34:36.690
it wouldn't be so bad.

00:34:38.110 --> 00:34:38.770
Master,

00:34:39.400 --> 00:34:40.250
I may be useless,

00:34:40.630 --> 00:34:41.500
but I'm not a monster!

00:34:41.500 --> 00:34:42.610
That's exactly why

00:34:43.030 --> 00:34:44.610
I can't bring myself to cast you out.

00:34:44.920 --> 00:34:45.820
Do you understand?

00:35:11.960 --> 00:35:13.900
Wushuang City is not so lofty

00:35:14.760 --> 00:35:16.380
as to stand apart from the world.

00:35:17.710 --> 00:35:18.610
But even if it is

00:35:18.630 --> 00:35:20.130
no longer peerless under heaven,

00:35:21.550 --> 00:35:23.420
the spirit of our forebears still endures.

00:35:39.760 --> 00:35:41.210
Do you think what's happening here

00:35:41.230 --> 00:35:42.540
is spontaneous

00:35:42.760 --> 00:35:44.090
or the result of someone's careful design?

00:35:45.960 --> 00:35:47.940
The papers I took from the Wanjuan Tower

00:35:48.440 --> 00:35:49.460
had been switched beforehand,

00:35:50.150 --> 00:35:51.540
but their contents were genuine.

00:35:53.320 --> 00:35:54.130
So my coming here

00:35:55.150 --> 00:35:56.690
is something someone wanted to happen.

00:35:57.000 --> 00:35:58.860
And you're willing to be used like that?

00:35:59.880 --> 00:36:01.170
Since the contents were true,

00:36:02.070 --> 00:36:03.730
this is something I must do.

00:36:03.960 --> 00:36:05.380
If someone wants to use me,

00:36:07.190 --> 00:36:08.860
they'll just have to pay the price.

00:36:09.320 --> 00:36:09.940
Fair enough.

00:36:10.360 --> 00:36:11.280
And since it's irritating

00:36:11.280 --> 00:36:12.460
that so many eyes

00:36:12.880 --> 00:36:13.940
are watching us in the dark,

00:36:14.280 --> 00:36:15.570
let's use this chance to see

00:36:15.880 --> 00:36:17.170
who's really behind it.

00:36:24.360 --> 00:36:25.090
Miss Bai?

00:36:26.920 --> 00:36:27.690
Your beloved umbrella.

00:36:27.760 --> 00:36:28.610
You brought it?

00:36:29.280 --> 00:36:29.900
Thank you.

00:36:30.590 --> 00:36:31.340
Of course.

00:36:31.590 --> 00:36:33.460
I figured you'd need it.

00:36:33.710 --> 00:36:35.090
Even if it's not for fighting,

00:36:35.360 --> 00:36:36.540
it can at least keep off the rain.

00:36:39.590 --> 00:36:40.690
Then take this for protection,

00:36:41.230 --> 00:36:41.980
Miss Bai.

00:36:42.440 --> 00:36:43.130
All right.

00:36:45.590 --> 00:36:46.380
Mr. Zhuo,

00:36:46.710 --> 00:36:48.340
you've gained quite a reputation lately.

00:36:50.000 --> 00:36:51.190
I thought I was the only one who came

00:36:51.190 --> 00:36:52.020
to watch the show.

00:36:53.110 --> 00:36:54.170
Watch the show? We're all

00:36:54.170 --> 00:36:55.060
about to lose our lives.

00:36:55.670 --> 00:36:57.060
Fortunately, before I set out,

00:36:57.230 --> 00:36:58.690
my eyelid kept twitching,

00:36:59.030 --> 00:37:00.380
so I made extra preparations.

00:37:00.710 --> 00:37:01.420
It's only

00:37:01.440 --> 00:37:02.500
a few minions.

00:37:02.960 --> 00:37:04.340
We've been through much worse.

00:37:04.710 --> 00:37:06.610
A bit of internal chaos in Wushuang City...

00:37:07.030 --> 00:37:08.500
I can't believe the Patriarch of Blood River

00:37:08.550 --> 00:37:09.820
is actually so careless.

00:37:10.510 --> 00:37:11.980
Take a careful breath.

00:37:12.230 --> 00:37:13.250
Do you notice anything strange?

00:37:15.920 --> 00:37:18.820
There's a faint floral scent.

00:37:20.030 --> 00:37:20.860
In this season,

00:37:21.550 --> 00:37:23.130
what flowers could still be blooming in Sihuai City?

00:37:23.880 --> 00:37:25.290
Sihuai City

00:37:25.320 --> 00:37:26.340
is not Xueyue City.

00:37:26.440 --> 00:37:27.980
We don't have that kind of romance here.

00:37:28.670 --> 00:37:29.420
Floral scent?

00:37:30.110 --> 00:37:31.130
All I've smelled on the way here

00:37:31.320 --> 00:37:33.020
is wine and meat.

00:37:33.480 --> 00:37:34.460
It's poison.

00:37:35.480 --> 00:37:36.650
It is poison indeed.

00:37:36.960 --> 00:37:38.860
It just hasn't fully taken hold yet.

00:37:39.280 --> 00:37:40.770
Once the scent thickens

00:37:41.150 --> 00:37:43.460
and it feels as if you're standing in a sea of blossoms,

00:37:43.800 --> 00:37:44.820
that will be the perfect time

00:37:45.030 --> 00:37:47.420
for them to carve you up.

00:38:13.590 --> 00:38:14.380
The Five Poisons?

00:38:16.320 --> 00:38:18.170
Yes, and they're the supreme kind that only a direct heir

00:38:18.400 --> 00:38:19.540
of the Wen clan

00:38:19.760 --> 00:38:20.690
can raise.

00:38:22.150 --> 00:38:22.900
Go.

00:38:23.150 --> 00:38:23.980
I've heard

00:38:24.230 --> 00:38:25.480
they're even stronger than those

00:38:25.480 --> 00:38:26.290
of the Five Poisons Sect.

00:38:26.550 --> 00:38:27.610
I've seen

00:38:27.710 --> 00:38:28.900
Wen Hujiu's Five Poisons.

00:38:29.360 --> 00:38:30.460
His centipedes

00:38:30.590 --> 00:38:31.690
had two heads.
