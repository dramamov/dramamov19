=Episode 17=

00:00:33.823 --> 00:00:35.983
I've finally taken my revenge.

00:00:46.743 --> 00:00:49.343
With this half
of my inner core protecting you,

00:00:49.543 --> 00:00:51.663
no matter how great the danger,

00:00:51.743 --> 00:00:52.983
you'll never die.

00:00:54.143 --> 00:00:54.943
Thank you.

00:00:54.943 --> 00:00:56.103
I'll never forget you.

00:00:56.103 --> 00:00:57.743
(Tushan Yue.)

00:00:58.623 --> 00:01:00.063
Lotus Core.

00:01:02.743 --> 00:01:03.543
This...

00:01:04.623 --> 00:01:06.863
This is my inner core.

00:01:11.623 --> 00:01:12.623
Yaya?

00:01:15.343 --> 00:01:17.183
Are you Yaya?

00:01:18.783 --> 00:01:20.623
Are you really Yaya?

00:01:25.943 --> 00:01:26.943
The Gu...

00:01:31.023 --> 00:01:31.943
Yaya,

00:01:32.423 --> 00:01:34.423
are you really being controlled
by someone?

00:01:34.783 --> 00:01:35.903
You can't die, Yaya!

00:01:36.143 --> 00:01:37.023
You can't!

00:01:37.023 --> 00:01:38.543
I won't let you!

00:01:38.623 --> 00:01:39.543
Wake up

00:01:39.543 --> 00:01:41.343
and tell me what happened!

00:01:41.463 --> 00:01:42.063
Yaya!

00:01:42.343 --> 00:01:43.423
Wake up!

00:01:43.423 --> 00:01:44.303
Wake up.

00:01:44.663 --> 00:01:45.823
Don't die.

00:01:46.263 --> 00:01:48.703
Tell me what happened to you.

00:01:49.343 --> 00:01:50.063
Yaya.

00:01:51.863 --> 00:01:53.943
Wake up!

00:02:14.343 --> 00:02:16.743
I finally found you, Yaya.

00:02:23.463 --> 00:02:24.343
But...

00:02:28.623 --> 00:02:31.143
I killed you with my own hands.

00:02:52.623 --> 00:02:54.463
Yaya? Yaya!

00:02:56.183 --> 00:02:57.423
You're awake.

00:03:01.823 --> 00:03:03.223
Where am I?

00:03:05.663 --> 00:03:06.863
Why are you crying?

00:03:08.903 --> 00:03:10.343
I'm so glad you're alive.

00:03:11.263 --> 00:03:12.103
Xiling Xuan,

00:03:12.703 --> 00:03:15.143
you killed all those demons
on Mount Yao.

00:03:15.623 --> 00:03:17.703
I'll kill you to avenge them!

00:03:18.063 --> 00:03:21.520
Youyou, wait! Hear me out.
Someone might have been controlling him.

00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:23.143
Let me get those answers
out of him, please.

00:03:23.143 --> 00:03:24.023
Move!

00:03:24.023 --> 00:03:25.423
He has to die now!

00:03:25.423 --> 00:03:26.423
Youyou, wait...

00:03:33.903 --> 00:03:34.463
Your Majesty,

00:03:35.143 --> 00:03:36.343
she's the demon.

00:03:36.703 --> 00:03:37.543
Kill her.

00:03:38.023 --> 00:03:38.823
No!

00:03:40.823 --> 00:03:41.663
Your Majesty.

00:03:41.983 --> 00:03:44.503
She's gravely wounded.
She doesn't have long to live.

00:03:44.543 --> 00:03:46.423
There's no need
for you to sully your hands.

00:03:46.423 --> 00:03:47.223
Xin'er,

00:03:47.503 --> 00:03:48.823
all demons are wicked.

00:03:49.063 --> 00:03:50.663
I am merely serving justice.

00:03:51.063 --> 00:03:52.063
Your Majesty,

00:03:52.303 --> 00:03:53.623
I understand.

00:03:54.423 --> 00:03:57.103
But she's still a living being.

00:03:59.103 --> 00:04:00.343
A while ago,

00:04:00.543 --> 00:04:02.743
I went to the temple to pray,

00:04:03.063 --> 00:04:04.183
hoping the heavens

00:04:04.303 --> 00:04:06.663
would help me recover soon

00:04:06.663 --> 00:04:08.743
and give you a prince.

00:04:11.263 --> 00:04:15.063
If you decide to kill it,

00:04:16.463 --> 00:04:18.303
it won't be good for our child.

00:04:19.823 --> 00:04:20.503
Very well.

00:04:20.783 --> 00:04:21.983
As you wish, Xin'er.

00:04:22.103 --> 00:04:22.903
She shall be freed.

00:04:23.263 --> 00:04:24.063
Good.

00:04:24.103 --> 00:04:24.903
Your Majesty.

00:04:27.303 --> 00:04:28.943
You dare defy my will?

00:04:29.903 --> 00:04:30.703
Let her go.

00:04:32.543 --> 00:04:33.343
Let her go.

00:04:40.143 --> 00:04:40.863
Xin'er,

00:04:41.343 --> 00:04:42.423
I'll take you back.

00:04:42.943 --> 00:04:43.903
All right.

00:05:24.023 --> 00:05:24.983
Don't worry.

00:05:25.743 --> 00:05:27.023
She's fine.

00:05:34.223 --> 00:05:34.943
Yaya.

00:05:38.663 --> 00:05:39.703
I'm not Yaya.

00:05:41.143 --> 00:05:42.423
You've got the wrong person.

00:05:50.943 --> 00:05:52.223
You knew it was me,

00:05:52.223 --> 00:05:53.023
didn't you?

00:05:55.863 --> 00:05:58.543
That's why you saved me
time and time again.

00:06:00.823 --> 00:06:02.343
You knew it was me.

00:06:03.663 --> 00:06:05.463
Why didn't you tell me?

00:06:09.863 --> 00:06:12.023
I didn't want you to get hurt.

00:06:15.343 --> 00:06:17.343
You didn't want to hurt me?

00:06:19.303 --> 00:06:20.303
Yesterday,

00:06:21.543 --> 00:06:24.943
306 deer demons
were slaughtered on Mount Yao.

00:06:26.543 --> 00:06:27.863
Three days ago,

00:06:28.423 --> 00:06:31.543
586 rabbit demons
were massacred on Mount Yao.

00:06:33.623 --> 00:06:35.023
15 days ago,

00:06:37.423 --> 00:06:38.823
the entire fox clan on Mount Yao

00:06:40.943 --> 00:06:42.663
was wiped out.

00:06:46.623 --> 00:06:48.303
Do you know who did it?

00:07:00.143 --> 00:07:01.023
It was me.

00:07:01.023 --> 00:07:01.943
That's right.

00:07:02.943 --> 00:07:03.943
It was you.

00:07:09.943 --> 00:07:11.423
That means

00:07:13.423 --> 00:07:14.623
I killed you.

00:07:16.663 --> 00:07:18.823
That's why your last wisp of soul

00:07:19.543 --> 00:07:20.543
came here.

00:07:21.943 --> 00:07:23.143
You came seeking revenge.

00:07:25.143 --> 00:07:26.143
Yaya.

00:07:28.543 --> 00:07:30.543
Why was it you of all people?

00:07:32.743 --> 00:07:33.863
We were...

00:07:34.463 --> 00:07:35.263
We were...

00:07:40.383 --> 00:07:41.183
I'm sorry.

00:07:42.543 --> 00:07:43.183
Yue,

00:07:46.543 --> 00:07:47.743
kill me.

00:08:11.343 --> 00:08:12.743
If I kill you,

00:08:14.343 --> 00:08:15.623
I'll never be able to find

00:08:15.623 --> 00:08:17.223
the true mastermind

00:08:18.543 --> 00:08:20.703
controlling you with the Gu.

00:08:23.623 --> 00:08:25.343
Controlling me

00:08:25.863 --> 00:08:27.143
with the Gu?

00:08:37.795 --> 00:08:38.995
Tell the Imperial Medical Court

00:08:38.995 --> 00:08:41.075
to restore the Empress's health
as swiftly as possible.

00:08:41.235 --> 00:08:44.075
I want to have an heir with her
as soon as possible.

00:08:45.395 --> 00:08:46.195
Yes, Your Majesty.

00:08:48.875 --> 00:08:49.875
Go on, then.

00:08:52.475 --> 00:08:53.275
Your Majesty,

00:08:53.795 --> 00:08:55.795
do you remember the rule you once set?

00:08:56.835 --> 00:08:57.755
Of course.

00:08:59.075 --> 00:09:00.595
No matter what the obstacles,

00:09:00.755 --> 00:09:02.555
all the demons on Mount Yao
must be slain.

00:09:02.595 --> 00:09:04.675
Then why did Your Majesty
spare that demon today?

00:09:06.075 --> 00:09:07.435
You dare question me?

00:09:08.835 --> 00:09:09.675
I dare not.

00:09:10.075 --> 00:09:11.155
I just feel

00:09:11.235 --> 00:09:12.875
that Your Majesty has changed recently.

00:09:13.138 --> 00:09:14.240
You've shown tremendous care

00:09:14.240 --> 00:09:16.218
for Her Majesty and you seem
to grant her every wish.

00:09:17.138 --> 00:09:18.618
I love Xin'er.

00:09:18.618 --> 00:09:20.338
Why shouldn't I do what pleases her?

00:09:20.338 --> 00:09:22.378
But today, because of her,

00:09:22.458 --> 00:09:24.138
you spared your most hated demon.

00:09:25.743 --> 00:09:28.063
You've never shown
this much concern for her before.

00:09:28.303 --> 00:09:30.263
Do you remember when you started

00:09:30.343 --> 00:09:31.623
caring so much for her?

00:09:34.823 --> 00:09:35.623
I...

00:09:38.743 --> 00:09:40.343
I've loved her since birth.

00:09:40.343 --> 00:09:42.263
But she's the princess
of the neighboring kingdom.

00:09:42.303 --> 00:09:44.143
You only met on your wedding day.

00:09:44.423 --> 00:09:46.143
How can you say
you've loved her since birth?

00:09:54.463 --> 00:09:55.143
Your Majesty.

00:09:55.143 --> 00:09:56.103
Silence!

00:09:56.183 --> 00:09:56.883
Get out of my sight!

00:10:05.735 --> 00:10:06.535
What...

00:10:06.783 --> 00:10:08.263
What's wrong with me?

00:10:19.750 --> 00:10:20.630
(Yue,)

00:10:20.903 --> 00:10:22.143
(I've returned to Mount Yao.)

00:10:22.663 --> 00:10:23.343
(There are many)

00:10:23.343 --> 00:10:25.503
(severely injured demons there)

00:10:25.503 --> 00:10:26.423
(who need care.)

00:10:26.943 --> 00:10:28.223
(They don't know that Xiling Xuan)

00:10:28.223 --> 00:10:29.863
(is being controlled by the Gu.)

00:10:30.343 --> 00:10:32.063
(They wish
they could tear him to pieces.)

00:10:32.823 --> 00:10:33.943
(After I return to Mount Yao,)

00:10:34.103 --> 00:10:35.943
(I'll try to explain everything
to everyone.)

00:10:36.543 --> 00:10:38.823
(Be careful and take care of yourself.)

00:10:39.423 --> 00:10:40.463
(If you ever need help,)

00:10:40.663 --> 00:10:42.063
(send word to Mount Yao.)

00:10:42.503 --> 00:10:43.823
(I'll always come to your aid.)

00:10:44.703 --> 00:10:45.543
(Youyou.)

00:10:47.343 --> 00:10:48.503
(I will find the mastermind)

00:10:48.503 --> 00:10:49.903
(behind this as soon as possible)

00:10:50.543 --> 00:10:51.663
(and avenge everyone.)

00:10:53.463 --> 00:10:55.943
Your Majesty!

00:10:56.263 --> 00:10:58.063
Something's wrong, Your Majesty!

00:10:58.543 --> 00:10:59.343
What happened?

00:11:00.623 --> 00:11:01.303
His Lordship...

00:11:01.303 --> 00:11:02.143
His Lordship...

00:11:02.703 --> 00:11:04.743
He went to Mount Yao last night.

00:11:04.743 --> 00:11:06.863
He drained himself almost dry

00:11:08.343 --> 00:11:11.743
to save the injured demons.

00:11:11.863 --> 00:11:14.983
I... I fear he may not survive.

00:11:16.120 --> 00:11:17.463
Where is he now?

00:11:40.783 --> 00:11:41.583
Yue...

00:11:45.343 --> 00:11:46.143
Yaya...

00:11:56.143 --> 00:11:57.543
Let's join forces.

00:11:59.143 --> 00:12:02.143
We'll find the true mastermind
that's controlling you together.

00:12:06.503 --> 00:12:07.383
