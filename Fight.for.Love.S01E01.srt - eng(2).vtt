(ordered General Chu Jianchang
of the Northwest)

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:58.480
(to defend Fengling City until the end.)

00:01:58.760 --> 00:02:00.920

Study supplies!

00:02:57.150 --> 00:02:58.310
This is my first time eating here.

00:02:58.310 --> 00:02:59.190
Freshly fried.

00:02:59.190 --> 00:03:00.150
It smells amazing.

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:01.000
It's right out of the pot.

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:01.840
Smells so nice.

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:07.520
Good. Good.

Look!

- Look how sturdy this one is.
- Really?

Isn't that the young general in white,

00:04:32.760 --> 00:04:33.880
who pacified the northern border,

00:04:33.890 --> 00:04:34.700
Seventh Young Master Wei?

00:04:35.160 --> 00:04:36.870
The Wei family has returned in triumph!

00:04:56.800 --> 00:04:58.240
Look! There's someone up there!

00:04:59.120 --> 00:04:59.960
Impressive.

00:05:05.750 --> 00:05:07.120
She seems to be Lady Chu Yu of the Chu family.

00:05:07.120 --> 00:05:08.120
The Wei family has returned.

00:05:08.120 --> 00:05:08.960
What is she doing here?

00:05:19.480 --> 00:05:23.090
Bravo!

Lady Chu Yu

is the famous eccentric.

00:05:50.240 --> 00:05:51.160
Didn't she once elope

00:05:51.160 --> 00:05:52.000
with Academician Gu,

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:52.980
(Wei)
only to be abandoned

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:54.310
and become the laughingstock of Huajing?

00:05:55.310 --> 00:05:57.240
And now, what is she doing?

00:06:09.940 --> 00:06:14.990
Bravo!

00:06:20.320 --> 00:06:21.660
Bravo!

(Mingliu, Star Courtesan of Fragrance House)
Lady Chu Yu

00:06:25.500 --> 00:06:27.240
blocks the road, could it be that,
after the Chu family's

00:06:27.240 --> 00:06:28.130
fall, she's here to challenge

00:06:28.430 --> 00:06:29.680
the Wei family out of resentment?

00:06:33.870 --> 00:06:34.710
Lady Chu,

00:06:35.390 --> 00:06:36.720
the Wei family returns victorious today.

00:06:37.630 --> 00:06:38.560
Could you please

00:06:39.040 --> 00:06:40.120
let us pass first?

00:06:41.750 --> 00:06:42.590
Wei soldiers.

00:06:42.920 --> 00:06:43.800
Come on.

00:06:43.800 --> 00:06:44.920
Make way, make way!

00:06:49.560 --> 00:06:50.680
Where's the rest of your family?

00:06:51.310 --> 00:06:52.150
The rest?

00:06:53.830 --> 00:06:54.750
What do you mean by that?

00:06:55.750 --> 00:06:57.680
Are you waiting for someone?

00:07:07.620 --> 00:07:12.100

(Gu Chusheng,
Senior Compiler of the Hanlin Academy)

00:07:26.560 --> 00:07:27.870
Isn't that Academician Gu, the one

00:07:27.870 --> 00:07:28.710
who abandoned her?

00:07:31.040 --> 00:07:33.000
So she was waiting

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:35.040
for him.

00:07:42.160 --> 00:07:43.560
I am confronting him!

00:07:44.040 --> 00:07:44.880
So what?

00:07:55.480 --> 00:07:56.680
People say Academician Gu

00:07:56.680 --> 00:07:58.160
is an upright official.

00:07:58.950 --> 00:08:00.360
How can such a man be so faithless?

00:08:01.270 --> 00:08:03.040
(Wei Qiu, Wei Yun's Guard)
You don't know what happened

00:08:03.240 --> 00:08:04.080
between them.

00:08:06.950 --> 00:08:08.120
Five years ago...

00:08:08.870 --> 00:08:09.710
Gu,

00:08:09.870 --> 00:08:10.870
I'll go with you

00:08:11.160 --> 00:08:12.000
to the southwest border.

00:08:13.510 --> 00:08:14.430
I'm being exiled.

00:08:15.360 --> 00:08:16.960
You don't have to share my hardship.

00:08:17.360 --> 00:08:18.200
Gu Chusheng,

00:08:18.800 --> 00:08:19.750
as long as I'm willing,

00:08:20.120 --> 00:08:21.560
I'll brave anything.

00:08:22.040 --> 00:08:22.880
I just ask,

00:08:23.040 --> 00:08:24.120
do you dare take me with you?

00:08:35.220 --> 00:08:37.040
I know we've separated.

00:08:38.240 --> 00:08:39.480
But right now, you're the only one

00:08:39.480 --> 00:08:40.570
I can turn to.

00:08:42.530 --> 00:08:44.290
My father and brother are holding Fengling
to the last.

00:08:44.720 --> 00:08:46.320
If the court doesn't send reinforcements,

00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:48.600
they'll surely perish.

00:08:49.120 --> 00:08:50.120
I'm just an academician.

00:08:50.910 --> 00:08:52.480
How could I influence His Majesty's decision?

00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:54.840
Gu Chusheng,

00:08:56.120 --> 00:08:56.960
please, I beg you!

00:09:00.960 --> 00:09:01.800
Get up.

00:09:02.390 --> 00:09:03.270
Please.

00:09:03.750 --> 00:09:04.600
I beg you.

00:09:05.630 --> 00:09:06.600
Save my father,

00:09:06.840 --> 00:09:07.840
save my brother!

00:09:09.960 --> 00:09:11.630
You're the only one I can ask!

00:09:12.600 --> 00:09:13.440
Please.

00:09:18.360 --> 00:09:19.360
Court affairs

00:09:20.870 --> 00:09:22.240
are not changed

00:09:23.480 --> 00:09:25.320
by mere words from someone.

00:09:30.080 --> 00:09:31.510
The Chu family can no longer help you

00:09:32.510 --> 00:09:34.360
on the path you seek in the imperial service,

00:09:35.270 --> 00:09:36.110
is that so?

00:09:38.120 --> 00:09:39.200
And now it's the day

00:09:39.360 --> 00:09:40.840
you marry into the Duke of Ning's

00:09:40.840 --> 00:09:41.680
noble house.

00:09:42.360 --> 00:09:43.720
Truly, fate loves its cruel jokes.

00:09:44.550 --> 00:09:45.390
My lord,

00:09:45.390 --> 00:09:47.080
I'll have this dealt with immediately.

00:09:47.080 --> 00:09:49.180
(Zhang Deng, Gu Chusheng's Page Boy)
Your wedding will not be delayed!

00:09:58.270 --> 00:09:59.360
What's Academician Gu doing?

00:09:59.860 --> 00:10:00.840
He's going.

00:10:02.360 --> 00:10:03.270
Why's he going up there?

00:10:03.270 --> 00:10:04.120
What is he doing?

00:10:04.120 --> 00:10:05.240
Now this will be interesting.

00:10:09.270 --> 00:10:10.110
Chu Yu,

00:10:10.440 --> 00:10:11.600
I know I wronged you.

00:10:12.030 --> 00:10:12.960
But why ruin

00:10:12.960 --> 00:10:13.800
your reputation

00:10:14.510 --> 00:10:15.390
like this,

00:10:15.390 --> 00:10:16.240
before everyone?

00:10:17.240 --> 00:10:18.840
You're not one to cling to the past.

00:10:21.150 --> 00:10:22.080
If so,

00:10:22.960 --> 00:10:24.030
why stand here?

00:10:24.750 --> 00:10:25.590
Do you mean

00:10:25.720 --> 00:10:26.750
to personally persuade me

00:10:26.750 --> 00:10:27.840
not to ruin my marriage?

00:10:28.240 --> 00:10:29.080
I'm standing here...

00:10:37.510 --> 00:10:39.200
I'm standing here to stop you.

00:10:39.800 --> 00:10:40.910
Now that the Chu family has fallen,

00:10:41.200 --> 00:10:42.790
you should find your own path.

00:10:43.480 --> 00:10:44.320
As for me,

00:10:45.670 --> 00:10:47.270
I have a future I must face.

00:10:48.440 --> 00:10:49.280
There's no longer

00:10:50.150 --> 00:10:51.080
anything between us.

00:10:56.630 --> 00:10:57.470
Gu Chusheng,

00:10:58.600 --> 00:11:00.720
should I say you know me,

00:11:01.360 --> 00:11:02.320
or that you don't?

00:11:06.460 --> 00:11:08.500
(Wei Jun, First Son of the Wei Family)

00:11:08.510 --> 00:11:09.840
The Wei Army is amazing!

00:11:09.840 --> 00:11:10.800
Look at their vigor and pride.

00:11:22.480 --> 00:11:23.320
Yun,

00:11:25.080 --> 00:11:26.560
Father sent you to deliver the good news.

00:11:27.030 --> 00:11:27.890
The army

00:11:27.900 --> 00:11:28.980
has finished assembling in camp

00:11:28.990 --> 00:11:29.750
and awaits inspection.

00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:30.990
Yet you still haven't returned.

00:11:33.200 --> 00:11:34.680
What are you doing here?

00:11:34.960 --> 00:11:35.800
Jun, look.

00:11:36.120 --> 00:11:37.440
Today Academician Gu is getting married,

00:11:37.600 --> 00:11:38.480
but Lady Chu is purposely

00:11:38.480 --> 00:11:39.720
blocking him from Spring Breeze House.

00:11:40.480 --> 00:11:42.030
The road into the city is jammed.

00:11:42.030 --> 00:11:42.870
You can't get in.

00:11:43.550 --> 00:11:44.960
Might as well watch the show here.

00:11:45.750 --> 00:11:46.720
Sounds good.

00:11:46.960 --> 00:11:47.960
Usually it's all battles,

00:11:48.360 --> 00:11:49.200
no show.

00:11:50.340 --> 00:11:52.660
(Wei Ya, Fifth Son; Wei Feng, Fourth Son;
Wei Shu, Second Son)

00:11:53.100 --> 00:11:55.540
(Wei Qin, Third Son; Wei Rong, Sixth Son)

00:11:56.390 --> 00:11:57.630
The Wei Army is glorious!

00:11:58.440 --> 00:12:00.120
The Wei Army is glorious!

00:12:00.510 --> 00:12:02.200
Jun, just watch a little.

00:12:02.200 --> 00:12:07.870
The Wei Army is glorious!

00:12:07.870 --> 00:12:08.710
Indeed,

00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:10.870
I'm never one to cling to the past.

00:12:11.510 --> 00:12:12.440
How do you know

00:12:12.440 --> 00:12:13.360
I came for you?

00:12:15.020 --> 00:12:17.350
The Wei Army is glorious!

00:12:17.780 --> 00:12:18.740
Look!

00:12:18.740 --> 00:12:19.700
(Fair gentleman!)

00:12:25.900 --> 00:12:28.980
(Fair gentleman! Sweet lady's)

00:12:30.230 --> 00:12:31.640
Chu Yu, enough.

00:12:31.640 --> 00:12:32.480
Stop it right now.

00:12:33.800 --> 00:12:34.640
Academician Gu,

00:12:35.160 --> 00:12:36.560
today is your wedding day.

00:12:36.830 --> 00:12:37.750
If you stay here,

00:12:37.950 --> 00:12:39.470
aren't you afraid the Duke of Ning will notice?

00:12:42.020 --> 00:12:45.180
What gentleman?

00:12:46.020 --> 00:12:48.060
What good mate?

00:12:50.460 --> 00:12:51.300
Jun, Jun,

00:12:51.820 --> 00:12:52.660
what does this mean?

00:13:04.700 --> 00:13:07.060
(Fair gentleman! Sweet lady's good mate.)

00:13:10.420 --> 00:13:11.340
It reads,

00:13:11.650 --> 00:13:12.700
"Fair gentleman!

00:13:12.890 --> 00:13:13.850
Sweet lady's good mate."

00:13:16.300 --> 00:13:18.100
Today I have come for

00:13:18.250 --> 00:13:19.180
Young General Wei Jun.

00:13:21.940 --> 00:13:23.330
- Me?
- Yes.

00:13:23.940 --> 00:13:25.460
I've long admired

00:13:25.700 --> 00:13:26.540
your bravery.

00:13:27.580 --> 00:13:29.610
I'm no noblewoman, but I learned

00:13:29.820 --> 00:13:30.820
martial arts as a child.

00:13:31.250 --> 00:13:32.340
If war breaks out,

00:13:32.580 --> 00:13:33.700
I can go to battle with you.

00:13:34.100 --> 00:13:35.010
Do I deserve you

00:13:35.370 --> 00:13:36.250
in your eyes?

00:13:42.220 --> 00:13:43.300
So it was for Jun.

00:13:46.130 --> 00:13:46.970
Jun,

00:13:47.490 --> 00:13:48.610
Lady Chu put on

00:13:48.610 --> 00:13:49.850
such a show

00:13:50.180 --> 00:13:51.610
for you!

00:13:52.460 --> 00:13:53.700
- Jun, Jun.
- Jun.

00:13:53.700 --> 00:13:54.940
She did it for you.

00:13:54.940 --> 00:13:56.340
At least give her an answer!

00:13:56.610 --> 00:13:57.450
Yes.

00:14:01.180 --> 00:14:02.700
Thank you for your favor, Lady Chu,

00:14:02.890 --> 00:14:04.580
but I've pledged myself to the state.

00:14:04.730 --> 00:14:06.580
I'm not the right match for you.

00:14:11.740 --> 00:14:12.930
You said you're pledged

00:14:13.500 --> 00:14:14.740
to the state,

00:14:15.170 --> 00:14:16.740
but I am also a person of the state.

00:14:17.570 --> 00:14:19.260
How could I not be your match?

00:14:21.140 --> 00:14:22.170
If you care about

00:14:22.170 --> 00:14:23.010
gossip,

00:14:23.290 --> 00:14:24.130
I will say this:

00:14:24.650 --> 00:14:25.770
Chu Yu is a Chu.

00:14:26.340 --> 00:14:27.530
Though her house fell,

00:14:27.860 --> 00:14:29.130
the martial spirit remains unchanged.

00:14:33.740 --> 00:14:34.620
Report! Northwest General

00:14:34.740 --> 00:14:35.890
(Fengling City)
Chu Jianchang

00:14:36.100 --> 00:14:37.050
has fallen at Fengling City.

00:14:37.500 --> 00:14:38.530
General Chu Linyang

00:14:38.890 --> 00:14:39.860
is gravely wounded.

00:14:39.920 --> 00:14:42.120
(Sui)

00:14:49.890 --> 00:14:51.260
Lady Chu, rest assured.

00:14:51.530 --> 00:14:52.980
I never believed

00:14:52.980 --> 00:14:54.100
those rumors.

00:14:55.220 --> 00:14:56.980
Jun, do you know what you said

00:14:56.980 --> 00:14:58.380
- means yes?
- Wanyue.

00:14:58.380 --> 00:14:59.220
Here I am.

00:15:10.700 --> 00:15:13.540
(Fair gentleman! Sweet lady's good mate.)

00:15:57.830 --> 00:15:58.670
Young General Wei,

00:15:59.830 --> 00:16:00.670
I await your reply.

00:16:00.870 --> 00:16:01.710
Jun,

00:16:02.470 --> 00:16:03.320
she's suspicious.

00:16:09.800 --> 00:16:11.190
Seeing is believing.

00:16:11.790 --> 00:16:12.800
A woman revealing her feelings

00:16:12.800 --> 00:16:13.640
is rare.

00:16:13.920 --> 00:16:15.350
Lady Chu's boldness

00:16:15.920 --> 00:16:16.990
earns my respect.

00:16:19.560 --> 00:16:20.400
Yun,

00:16:20.860 --> 00:16:21.710
where is the thing

00:16:21.710 --> 00:16:22.640
fell from the pedals?

00:16:31.470 --> 00:16:32.680
I never meant to hide it.

00:16:34.590 --> 00:16:35.430
Here.

00:16:53.760 --> 00:16:54.630
Lady Chu, rest assured.

00:16:55.070 --> 00:16:55.910
I will

00:16:55.910 --> 00:16:56.830
give you

00:16:56.830 --> 00:16:57.760
a satisfactory answer.

00:17:00.320 --> 00:17:01.830
Good. I'll be waiting.

00:17:10.350 --> 00:17:11.190
Let's go.

00:17:35.580 --> 00:17:39.700
(Chu Mansion)

00:17:45.150 --> 00:17:46.070
Does Gu Chusheng

00:17:46.320 --> 00:17:47.390
really think

00:17:47.670 --> 00:17:49.000
we came for him today?

00:17:51.350 --> 00:17:52.480
What a narrow road for enemies.

00:17:53.070 --> 00:17:54.280
Who could've known his wedding

00:17:55.000 --> 00:17:56.590
would nearly ruin my plan?

00:17:56.830 --> 00:17:57.670
Exactly.

00:17:58.910 --> 00:18:00.240
She acts shameless

00:18:00.240 --> 00:18:01.080
and indecent!

00:18:01.760 --> 00:18:02.910
I'll be dragged down with her.

00:18:03.350 --> 00:18:04.280
How will I be able to

00:18:04.280 --> 00:18:05.120
go out now?

00:18:11.910 --> 00:18:13.350
My Lady, keep your voice down.

00:18:13.520 --> 00:18:14.830
Don't let your sister hear.

00:18:15.340 --> 00:18:17.260
(Chu Jin, Second Daughter of the Chu Family)

00:18:17.280 --> 00:18:18.480
I don't want such a sister!

00:18:18.810 --> 00:18:20.340
She's shamed the entire Chu family.

00:18:24.590 --> 00:18:25.520
Who are you cursing?

00:18:27.390 --> 00:18:28.390
I'm cursing you!

00:18:28.720 --> 00:18:30.070
You can be shameless all you want,

00:18:30.070 --> 00:18:31.630
but doing something so disgraceful,

00:18:31.830 --> 00:18:33.150
how are we supposed to live after this?

00:18:34.550 --> 00:18:36.110
you're selfish.

00:18:37.110 --> 00:18:37.950
You...

00:18:41.740 --> 00:18:42.870
You should be afraid.

00:18:43.780 --> 00:18:44.710
Remember,

00:18:44.710 --> 00:18:45.780
misfortune comes from the mouth.

00:18:46.500 --> 00:18:47.910
I'm tired today.

00:18:47.910 --> 00:18:48.750
I won't argue.

00:18:49.020 --> 00:18:50.670
Just watch your words from now on.

00:18:50.720 --> 00:18:51.580
I'm not someone

00:18:51.580 --> 00:18:52.420
to be trifled with.

00:18:53.630 --> 00:18:54.470
As if I'd be afraid of you!

00:19:00.430 --> 00:19:01.270
Lady Jin,

00:19:01.580 --> 00:19:03.190
how can you hit My Lady?

00:19:03.740 --> 00:19:04.980
Who asked you to speak?

00:19:05.230 --> 00:19:06.470
So what if I hit her?

00:19:07.710 --> 00:19:08.630
If you keep this up,

00:19:08.870 --> 00:19:09.710
I won't be polite.

00:19:10.230 --> 00:19:11.780
What? You'll hit me now?

00:19:12.190 --> 00:19:13.260
You did wrong and

00:19:13.260 --> 00:19:14.110
I can't even reprimand you?

00:19:14.910 --> 00:19:15.750
Say that again!

00:19:15.920 --> 00:19:16.820
I dare you!

00:19:16.820 --> 00:19:17.740
Let go of me!

00:19:17.910 --> 00:19:18.780
You're unreasonable!

00:19:18.950 --> 00:19:19.980
I am unreasonable?

00:19:20.390 --> 00:19:21.430
If you keep being so brazen,

00:19:21.430 --> 00:19:23.020
- Let go!
- my fists will be the law.

00:19:23.020 --> 00:19:24.510
- Let go!
- Do you understand?

00:19:28.290 --> 00:19:29.610
(Xie Yun, Old Madam of Chu Family)
What is it?

00:19:29.630 --> 00:19:30.480
Are you wrecking the house?

00:19:30.500 --> 00:19:31.370
Are you all right?

00:19:34.870 --> 00:19:35.910
Mother.

00:19:37.390 --> 00:19:38.230
What happened?

00:19:39.230 --> 00:19:40.500
Chu Yu hit me!

00:19:43.780 --> 00:19:45.190
- Are you alright?
- Always pretending.

00:19:45.190 --> 00:19:46.110
Mother,

00:19:46.110 --> 00:19:47.500
I only said she disregarded

00:19:47.500 --> 00:19:48.740
the Chu family's honor,

00:19:49.190 --> 00:19:50.460
she tried to beat me

00:19:50.460 --> 00:19:51.740
nearly to death.

00:19:53.260 --> 00:19:54.430
When did I ever try to kill you?

00:19:55.590 --> 00:19:56.430
Wasn't it you who

00:19:56.430 --> 00:19:57.700
first smashed a cup at me?

00:19:58.190 --> 00:19:59.220
If I hadn't held back,

00:19:59.500 --> 00:20:00.500
you'd be dead already.

00:20:01.070 --> 00:20:02.270
Sister, you're skilled in arms,

00:20:02.270 --> 00:20:03.380
how could I offend you?

00:20:03.660 --> 00:20:05.980
Just now, if I hadn't struggled,

00:20:05.980 --> 00:20:07.180
I'd have been killed.

00:20:07.180 --> 00:20:08.380
I had no choice but to fight back.

00:20:08.870 --> 00:20:09.940
And you still dare to lie.

00:20:10.310 --> 00:20:11.150
Madam,

00:20:11.350 --> 00:20:12.830
I clearly saw it.

00:20:13.140 --> 00:20:14.270
Lady Jin struck first

00:20:14.270 --> 00:20:15.110
and hit Lady Yu.

00:20:15.550 --> 00:20:16.590
You are her maid,

00:20:16.590 --> 00:20:17.870
of course you'll defend her.

00:20:17.870 --> 00:20:18.710
Enough.

00:20:21.460 --> 00:20:23.420
Even if your sister was wrong,

00:20:23.420 --> 00:20:24.830
shouldn't you give way?

00:20:25.200 --> 00:20:26.400
You grew up with your father

00:20:26.400 --> 00:20:27.570
and brother on the frontier

00:20:27.570 --> 00:20:28.410
and got used to freedom.

00:20:28.960 --> 00:20:30.720
I thought after coming to Huajing

00:20:30.720 --> 00:20:32.090
you'd become sensible,

00:20:32.920 --> 00:20:33.810
but you don't

00:20:34.610 --> 00:20:36.010
want to be a proper

00:20:36.010 --> 00:20:36.880
noble lady.

00:20:37.610 --> 00:20:39.680
You disgrace yourself

00:20:39.680 --> 00:20:40.960
in public.

00:20:41.290 --> 00:20:42.960
Have you considered the Chu family's honor?

00:20:43.770 --> 00:20:44.960
So what if your sister hit you?

00:20:45.330 --> 00:20:46.570
Didn't you deserve it?

00:20:51.880 --> 00:20:53.610
You didn't even ask me

00:20:54.050 --> 00:20:55.200
why I did that today.

00:20:55.640 --> 00:20:57.400
And you judged me

00:20:57.640 --> 00:20:58.880
based only on Chu Jin's word.

00:20:58.880 --> 00:21:01.200
Jin spoke the truth.

00:21:06.050 --> 00:21:07.370
You'll never believe me.

00:21:09.330 --> 00:21:10.290
Fine.

00:21:10.290 --> 00:21:11.130
I'm used to it.

00:21:11.920 --> 00:21:13.330
Think what you like.

00:21:13.680 --> 00:21:14.850
I won't change anyway.

00:21:19.030 --> 00:21:19.880
- Look at her!
- Madam.

00:21:19.880 --> 00:21:20.720
She...

00:21:21.050 --> 00:21:22.330
You're too biased.

00:21:24.880 --> 00:21:26.920
This... This makes me furious.

00:21:26.920 --> 00:21:28.160
Mother, it's all my fault.

00:21:28.160 --> 00:21:29.370
I shouldn't have angered her.

00:21:43.710 --> 00:21:46.230
(Chu Linyang, First Son of the Chu Family)

00:22:08.920 --> 00:22:10.330
Seeing you pick up the spear

00:22:10.330 --> 00:22:11.570
and display the Chu spearwork

00:22:11.920 --> 00:22:12.880
puts me at ease.

00:22:13.770 --> 00:22:15.120
After more than half a year of recovery,

00:22:15.680 --> 00:22:16.520
my health

00:22:16.810 --> 00:22:17.920
is fine now.

00:22:20.290 --> 00:22:21.130
That's good.

00:22:26.010 --> 00:22:26.850
What's wrong?

00:22:27.290 --> 00:22:29.290
Still angry at Mother and Jin?

00:22:29.810 --> 00:22:31.050
I'm used to it.

00:22:34.640 --> 00:22:35.480
Jin

00:22:35.880 --> 00:22:37.530
grew up by Mother's side.

00:22:37.850 --> 00:22:39.090
If Mother is sometimes unfair,

00:22:39.570 --> 00:22:40.410
it's understandable.

00:22:41.570 --> 00:22:42.410
Give her time.

00:22:42.880 --> 00:22:44.050
She'll come to understand you.

00:22:45.920 --> 00:22:46.760
Honestly,

00:22:48.050 --> 00:22:49.050
why are you getting close

00:22:49.610 --> 00:22:50.770
to Wei Jun?

00:22:56.150 --> 00:22:58.750
(Marquis of Zhenguo's Mansion)

00:23:10.200 --> 00:23:11.770
What I did today was out of desperation.

00:23:12.200 --> 00:23:13.040
Please keep it secret.

00:23:13.880 --> 00:23:15.530
If you forgive me,

00:23:16.250 --> 00:23:17.200
meet me at the pavilion

00:23:17.720 --> 00:23:19.810
in the eastern woods at dusk.

00:23:48.030 --> 00:23:48.880
So, it seems

00:23:48.880 --> 00:23:50.090
you weren't angered by me

00:23:50.090 --> 00:23:50.930
after all.

00:23:53.680 --> 00:23:54.570
At first,

00:23:54.570 --> 00:23:55.810
you nearly fooled me.

00:23:56.290 --> 00:23:57.130
But I know

00:23:57.810 --> 00:23:59.480
General Chu has just fallen for the country.

00:23:59.780 --> 00:24:01.120
You must observe three years of mourning.

00:24:02.160 --> 00:24:04.160
The Chu family can hold no celebrations
during this.

00:24:04.880 --> 00:24:05.720
Your public confession

00:24:06.090 --> 00:24:07.960
was only to divert suspicion.

00:24:09.120 --> 00:24:11.440
Have you not heard the rumors

00:24:11.880 --> 00:24:13.330
that I chase men in vain

00:24:13.330 --> 00:24:15.530
and long to marry into nobility?

00:24:17.050 --> 00:24:19.010
The city says Lady Chu is improper

00:24:19.570 --> 00:24:21.050
and rebellious.

00:24:22.460 --> 00:24:23.350
But I

00:24:23.660 --> 00:24:24.580
don't believe so.

00:24:24.810 --> 00:24:26.520
When you accompanied Gu Chusheng,

00:24:26.720 --> 00:24:28.570
that was an act of loyalty.

00:24:30.960 --> 00:24:32.290
Few are so true

00:24:33.090 --> 00:24:34.290
and faithful.

00:24:35.290 --> 00:24:36.160
People simply

00:24:36.160 --> 00:24:37.290
repeat false tales.

00:24:38.010 --> 00:24:38.850
Besides, today,

00:24:39.290 --> 00:24:40.440
I've seen the truth

00:24:41.160 --> 00:24:42.400
outside Spring Breeze House.

00:24:52.570 --> 00:24:53.640
Lady Chu, forgive me.

00:24:54.640 --> 00:24:55.810
I didn't mean to mention

00:24:55.810 --> 00:24:56.650
Gu Chusheng.

00:24:58.290 --> 00:24:59.610
There's no need for you to apologize.

00:24:59.850 --> 00:25:00.770
If anything,

00:25:00.770 --> 00:25:02.290
I should say sorry to you.

00:25:03.050 --> 00:25:04.810
My drastic move today

00:25:05.330 --> 00:25:06.770
was because I have something

00:25:06.920 --> 00:25:09.090
I need your help investigating.

00:25:09.770 --> 00:25:10.610
Please, speak.

00:25:11.680 --> 00:25:13.160
During the battle at Fengling, my father

00:25:13.810 --> 00:25:14.810
was killed

00:25:15.200 --> 00:25:16.480
by the North Qi army, using a strange

00:25:16.480 --> 00:25:17.400
new crossbow.

00:25:17.880 --> 00:25:19.250
My brother was badly injured as well.

00:25:20.330 --> 00:25:21.250
When I pressed him,

00:25:21.250 --> 00:25:22.090
he said

00:25:22.530 --> 00:25:23.640
the weapon's power

00:25:23.640 --> 00:25:24.480
was immense,

00:25:24.920 --> 00:25:25.960
its mechanism fired instantly,

00:25:26.250 --> 00:25:27.610
with no need for manual winding.

00:25:28.480 --> 00:25:29.320
I think

00:25:30.290 --> 00:25:31.130
you must know

00:25:31.440 --> 00:25:32.370
this crossbow

00:25:32.370 --> 00:25:33.210
better than I do.

00:25:38.680 --> 00:25:40.290
(Chu)
This is the Chu family's heirloom jade token.

00:25:41.570 --> 00:25:42.720
I swear on my family,

00:25:43.120 --> 00:25:44.290
every word I've said is true.

00:25:45.090 --> 00:25:46.380
(Chu)
Why are you getting close

00:25:46.400 --> 00:25:47.290
to Wei Jun?

00:25:48.250 --> 00:25:49.090
After Fengling,

00:25:49.570 --> 00:25:51.330
the Chu family was shattered.

00:25:52.680 --> 00:25:54.330
North Qi's weapon craft

00:25:54.330 --> 00:25:55.370
was never superior to ours,

00:25:56.010 --> 00:25:56.960
yet the octagonal crossbow

00:25:57.120 --> 00:25:58.400
that killed Father and injured you

00:25:58.680 --> 00:25:59.920
used a core trigger

00:25:59.920 --> 00:26:01.370
identical to the new

00:26:01.370 --> 00:26:02.210
Wei family design.

00:26:03.200 --> 00:26:04.040
And that weapon hasn't

00:26:04.370 --> 00:26:06.160
even been released publicly in Great Sui.

00:26:07.960 --> 00:26:09.400
So I must rely on the Wei family's strength

00:26:09.920 --> 00:26:11.720
to find the traitor
who leaked our military secrets

00:26:12.050 --> 00:26:13.160
and make him pay in blood.

00:26:14.810 --> 00:26:15.850
To the world,

00:26:16.570 --> 00:26:17.810
I'm just a woman

00:26:17.810 --> 00:26:18.650
who'd risk

00:26:19.160 --> 00:26:20.680
her reputation for love.

00:26:21.400 --> 00:26:22.960
So my public confession to Wei Jun,

00:26:23.920 --> 00:26:25.090
even if the court hears,

00:26:25.570 --> 00:26:27.570
they'll only laugh at my foolishness,

00:26:28.010 --> 00:26:29.330
never suspect my true intent.

00:26:31.290 --> 00:26:32.130
Yu,

00:26:33.370 --> 00:26:34.210
is it worth it?

00:26:34.850 --> 00:26:35.690
Brother,

00:26:37.160 --> 00:26:39.090
what did all our fighting

00:26:39.400 --> 00:26:40.640
bring us in the end?

00:26:41.120 --> 00:26:42.290
Did anyone care about Father's death

00:26:42.290 --> 00:26:43.250
or your injuries?

00:26:46.250 --> 00:26:47.400
After the Chu family's fall,

00:26:48.290 --> 00:26:49.370
I've never

00:26:49.370 --> 00:26:50.290
seen things clearer.

00:26:51.050 --> 00:26:51.960
What others won't care about,

00:26:52.290 --> 00:26:53.130
I will.

00:26:53.400 --> 00:26:54.290
What the world won't give me,

00:26:54.570 --> 00:26:55.480
I'll find myself.

00:26:56.880 --> 00:26:57.890
I don't care about anything else.

00:26:58.570 --> 00:26:59.570
I just want the truth.

00:27:02.330 --> 00:27:03.170
Brother,

00:27:04.880 --> 00:27:05.810
you understand me, don't you?

00:27:20.750 --> 00:27:22.630
Chu...

00:27:25.530 --> 00:27:27.160
It's not that I don't trust you.

00:27:27.850 --> 00:27:29.370
The Arsenal Bureau's new octagonal crossbow

00:27:29.720 --> 00:27:32.090
indeed uses that instant-firing trigger.

00:27:32.770 --> 00:27:34.770
But that mechanism is a state secret.

00:27:35.290 --> 00:27:36.440
How could the North Qi

00:27:36.440 --> 00:27:37.330
have obtained the design?

00:27:37.880 --> 00:27:39.090
That's exactly what I want to find out.

00:27:41.550 --> 00:27:42.390
Look!

00:27:42.510 --> 00:27:44.240
Jun really came to meet Lady Chu!

00:27:44.310 --> 00:27:45.500
- Something must be going on!
- Don't push!

00:27:45.510 --> 00:27:46.350
You're stepping on me!

00:27:48.760 --> 00:27:50.030
What do you think they're talking about?

00:27:50.070 --> 00:27:50.960
- Don't push!
- Make room!

00:27:52.960 --> 00:27:54.680
Yun, there's so much space outside,

00:27:54.720 --> 00:27:55.680
why squeeze in?

00:27:56.000 --> 00:27:57.440
I like being close to you!

00:27:57.960 --> 00:27:59.610
You suspect the Arsenal Bureau,

00:28:00.130 --> 00:28:01.960
and you know I oversee it,

00:28:02.690 --> 00:28:04.280
yet you still bring this matter to me.

00:28:07.240 --> 00:28:08.410
Aren't you afraid

00:28:10.130 --> 00:28:12.480
that I might be the very traitor you seek?

00:28:26.550 --> 00:28:27.390
Yun?

00:28:27.790 --> 00:28:28.630
What are you doing here?

00:28:29.750 --> 00:28:30.590
I...

00:28:36.430 --> 00:28:37.270
You five,

00:28:37.500 --> 00:28:38.350
come out too.

00:28:40.150 --> 00:28:40.990
Go on.

00:28:43.640 --> 00:28:45.050
Eavesdropping?

00:28:45.530 --> 00:28:46.600
Who taught you that?

00:28:48.640 --> 00:28:49.600
Yun.

00:28:50.090 --> 00:28:52.120
What? We can't hear you, Jun.

00:28:52.290 --> 00:28:53.130
We can't hear.

00:28:53.290 --> 00:28:54.880
- We're leaving now.
- Yes.

00:28:54.880 --> 00:28:56.090
Go, go, hurry.

00:28:56.090 --> 00:28:57.070
Told you you can't beat her.

00:29:02.720 --> 00:29:03.560
Stop.

00:29:08.160 --> 00:29:09.680
You haven't apologized

00:29:09.680 --> 00:29:10.520
to Lady Chu yet.

00:29:14.550 --> 00:29:15.720
She's three years

00:29:15.720 --> 00:29:16.750
older than you.

00:29:17.640 --> 00:29:18.960
Don't be rude.

00:29:25.070 --> 00:29:25.910
I'm sorry.

00:29:27.920 --> 00:29:29.200
Lady Chu, forgive his insolence.

00:29:30.510 --> 00:29:31.640
I'll discipline them at home.

00:29:32.310 --> 00:29:33.150
Never mind.

00:29:34.070 --> 00:29:34.910
Kids will be kids.

00:29:35.400 --> 00:29:36.480
I won't make an issue.

00:29:39.160 --> 00:29:40.400
What did I say to you earlier?

00:29:49.590 --> 00:29:50.670
Lately it's chilly.

00:29:50.900 --> 00:29:52.730
How about we go to Qinxi Valley
to avoid the cold tomorrow?

00:29:53.100 --> 00:29:53.940
Lady Chu,

00:29:53.940 --> 00:29:55.140
let's discuss it then.

00:29:56.500 --> 00:29:57.340
Sure.

00:29:58.500 --> 00:29:59.340
Goodbye.

00:30:04.540 --> 00:30:05.380
Let's go.

00:30:07.020 --> 00:30:07.860
Let's go home.

00:30:08.180 --> 00:30:09.020
Come on.

00:30:09.740 --> 00:30:10.580
I'll deal with you later.

00:30:37.420 --> 00:30:38.260
You are waiting for me?

00:30:38.860 --> 00:30:39.900
Why did you suddenly

00:30:39.900 --> 00:30:40.740
favor my brother

00:30:41.140 --> 00:30:42.460
when you had no ties before?

00:30:44.180 --> 00:30:45.460
Are you asking for him?

00:30:45.620 --> 00:30:46.460
Of course not.

00:30:46.620 --> 00:30:48.100
Do you think I'm unworthy

00:30:48.340 --> 00:30:49.180
and want to stop me?

00:30:50.620 --> 00:30:51.460
You're overthinking.

00:30:51.860 --> 00:30:52.820
My brother treats me well.

00:30:53.500 --> 00:30:54.460
I only want to be sure

00:30:54.860 --> 00:30:55.700
he won't be hurt,

00:30:56.140 --> 00:30:57.340
especially emotionally.

00:30:58.980 --> 00:30:59.820
Rest assured.

00:31:00.100 --> 00:31:01.020
I won't hurt him.

00:31:03.500 --> 00:31:04.340
You...

00:31:05.660 --> 00:31:07.220
Are you really with my brother?

00:31:09.020 --> 00:31:09.860
Want to know?

00:31:10.060 --> 00:31:11.140
Win, and I'll tell you.

00:31:51.830 --> 00:31:52.680
You lost.

00:32:13.240 --> 00:32:17.960
(Marquis of Zhenguo's Mansion)

00:32:17.960 --> 00:32:18.840
Looking at your palm,

00:32:19.240 --> 00:32:20.280
you're sure to have a chubby son.

00:32:22.400 --> 00:32:23.480
It's delicious.

00:32:24.360 --> 00:32:25.200
Why are you staring at me?

00:32:26.680 --> 00:32:27.680
Let Daddy see.

00:32:27.680 --> 00:32:28.600
Have you washed your hands?

00:32:28.680 --> 00:32:29.560
Father! Mother!

00:32:29.600 --> 00:32:30.440
- Father.
- Here.

00:32:30.440 --> 00:32:31.480
- Father! Mother!
- Let's eat, let's eat.

00:32:31.480 --> 00:32:32.320
Father.

00:32:32.800 --> 00:32:33.680
Meal time!

00:32:33.680 --> 00:32:34.520
Eat, eat, eat,

00:32:34.520 --> 00:32:35.480
you are still in the mood.

00:32:36.240 --> 00:32:37.290
Don't you worry?

00:32:37.300 --> 00:32:38.480
(Liu Xueyang, Marchioness of Zhenguo)

00:32:38.480 --> 00:32:40.320
(Wei Zhong, Marquis of Zhenguo)
After Lady Chu's spectacle,

00:32:40.520 --> 00:32:42.120
the whole city says

00:32:42.120 --> 00:32:43.240
Jun is marrying her.

00:32:43.920 --> 00:32:45.040
Lady Chu publicly begged to wed,

00:32:45.320 --> 00:32:46.200
I'm a bit envious.

00:32:47.320 --> 00:32:48.400
You're already wed.

00:32:48.400 --> 00:32:49.240
What's there to envy?

00:32:49.480 --> 00:32:51.040
If anyone should be envied, it's Yun.

00:32:51.640 --> 00:32:53.360
- Am I right?
- Yes.

00:32:53.360 --> 00:32:54.200
Right, right, right.

00:32:55.080 --> 00:32:56.040
Enough.

00:32:56.190 --> 00:32:57.040
The one who is most envious

00:32:57.040 --> 00:32:58.320
is you yourself.

00:32:59.040 --> 00:32:59.880
Eat more.

00:33:01.400 --> 00:33:02.240
Jun,

00:33:02.640 --> 00:33:04.040
what exactly is going on

00:33:04.040 --> 00:33:05.360
with Lady Chu?

00:33:06.000 --> 00:33:07.080
Yes, Jun,

00:33:07.600 --> 00:33:08.600
what's happening.

00:33:08.920 --> 00:33:09.760
Tell us.

00:33:09.960 --> 00:33:11.160
- Yes.
- That's right.

00:33:11.160 --> 00:33:12.000
What's going on, Jun?

00:33:12.080 --> 00:33:12.920
Tell us.

00:33:12.920 --> 00:33:13.800
- Come on.
- What's going on?

00:33:13.800 --> 00:33:14.680
Tell us.

00:33:17.080 --> 00:33:18.600
General Chu just fell in battle,

00:33:18.920 --> 00:33:20.720
and Young General Chu is injured.

00:33:21.360 --> 00:33:23.960
Lady Chu is trying to help

00:33:24.280 --> 00:33:25.720
hold up the family.

00:33:26.480 --> 00:33:27.560
That's no easy task.

00:33:27.880 --> 00:33:28.720
That

00:33:28.920 --> 00:33:29.880
doesn't sound right.

00:33:31.840 --> 00:33:33.560
You actually praise her so much?

00:33:38.000 --> 00:33:38.920
Father, Mother,

00:33:39.960 --> 00:33:41.040
Lady Chu

00:33:41.280 --> 00:33:42.920
is blunt by nature,

00:33:43.680 --> 00:33:44.640
but

00:33:44.640 --> 00:33:45.920
I find her interesting,

00:33:46.440 --> 00:33:47.280
and

00:33:47.720 --> 00:33:49.080
she suits Jun well.

00:33:54.160 --> 00:33:55.080
Yes.

00:33:55.080 --> 00:33:57.040
I agree with Feng.

00:33:57.040 --> 00:33:57.880
Right.

00:33:58.280 --> 00:33:59.240
I can't imagine how lively

00:33:59.240 --> 00:34:00.720
it would be if Lady Chu joined

00:34:00.720 --> 00:34:01.640
the Wei household.

00:34:02.440 --> 00:34:03.280
Exactly.

00:34:04.160 --> 00:34:05.600
I've always hoped for

00:34:05.600 --> 00:34:06.640
a big sister-in-law

00:34:06.840 --> 00:34:08.480
to help Mother

00:34:08.480 --> 00:34:09.680
manage the household.

00:34:10.120 --> 00:34:11.160
But

00:34:11.160 --> 00:34:12.320
Lady Chu

00:34:12.680 --> 00:34:14.280
is indeed different.

00:34:16.320 --> 00:34:17.240
She's born

00:34:17.520 --> 00:34:18.600
to a military family

00:34:18.920 --> 00:34:20.440
and raised on the frontier,

00:34:20.920 --> 00:34:22.320
naturally she's unlike

00:34:22.480 --> 00:34:23.320
Huajing women.

00:34:25.480 --> 00:34:26.720
As a woman

00:34:26.720 --> 00:34:27.720
she eloped for love

00:34:28.080 --> 00:34:29.560
and caused a scandal,

00:34:29.880 --> 00:34:30.880
regardless of private morals.

00:34:31.080 --> 00:34:32.240
Our military house must not

00:34:32.360 --> 00:34:33.480
intermarry with such a family.

00:34:35.200 --> 00:34:36.040
Eat more.

00:34:36.040 --> 00:34:37.040
Stop playing. Eat properly.

00:34:39.680 --> 00:34:41.240
Father, Mother, I'm full.

00:34:42.040 --> 00:34:43.600
I have some official business to attend.

00:34:43.600 --> 00:34:44.440
Excuse me.

00:34:44.960 --> 00:34:46.120
You barely eat anything.

00:34:46.520 --> 00:34:47.400
- Jun! Jun!
- Jun,

00:34:47.400 --> 00:34:48.280
you're not eating?

00:34:48.280 --> 00:34:49.480
- Jun.
- Enjoy your meal.

00:34:49.960 --> 00:34:51.200
- Look at him.
- Jun,

00:34:51.200 --> 00:34:52.160
where are you going?

00:34:52.160 --> 00:34:53.190
- Where are you going?
- Leaving now?

00:34:54.680 --> 00:34:55.640
You are not eating?

00:35:00.900 --> 00:35:01.780
I deliberately chose this

00:35:02.020 --> 00:35:03.180
at the market.

00:35:04.220 --> 00:35:05.060
Do you like it?

00:35:06.620 --> 00:35:09.100
(Jiang Chun, Wei Shu's Wife)

00:35:09.100 --> 00:35:09.940
I do.

00:35:29.560 --> 00:35:31.960
(Zhang Han, Wei Qin's Wife)
look, what's different about me today?

00:35:38.360 --> 00:35:39.200
You've gotten chubbier.

00:35:43.920 --> 00:35:45.550
I can't believe a blockhead like you

00:35:45.800 --> 00:35:47.070
actually got a wife.

00:35:51.860 --> 00:35:55.700
(Yao Jue, Wei Feng's Wife)

00:35:55.780 --> 00:35:57.420
The sky was fine earlier.

00:35:57.620 --> 00:35:59.580
Why did it suddenly rain?

00:35:59.580 --> 00:36:00.740
You heard it.

00:36:00.900 --> 00:36:02.500
Second Brother bought her wife jewelry.

00:36:03.220 --> 00:36:04.420
Why didn't you buy me anything?

00:36:09.630 --> 00:36:10.470
Tomorrow night,

00:36:10.870 --> 00:36:12.190
we'll taste tea

00:36:13.030 --> 00:36:14.870
and watch the moon.

00:36:18.550 --> 00:36:19.510
Did I hurt you?

00:36:24.070 --> 00:36:24.910
No.

00:36:25.920 --> 00:36:26.800
You bad boy!

00:36:27.760 --> 00:36:29.000
This was my favorite pastry.

00:36:29.960 --> 00:36:30.800
Try it.

00:36:32.100 --> 00:36:35.220
(Xie Jiu, Wei Ya's Wife)

00:36:43.380 --> 00:36:44.860
(Wang Lan, Wei Rong's Wife)

00:36:44.860 --> 00:36:46.020
He kicked me.

00:36:47.900 --> 00:36:48.820
Naughty boy,

00:36:49.140 --> 00:36:50.700
when I return victorious next time,

00:36:50.860 --> 00:36:52.060
you should be out already.

00:36:52.380 --> 00:36:53.980
By then, you and your mother will come

00:36:53.980 --> 00:36:54.940
to the city gate to welcome me,

00:36:55.140 --> 00:36:55.980
understand?

00:36:56.860 --> 00:36:57.860
Yes, Daddy.

00:37:19.590 --> 00:37:21.110
The Arsenal Bureau's octagonal crossbow

00:37:21.280 --> 00:37:22.150
harms both enemy and user,

00:37:23.360 --> 00:37:25.030
so it's never been used by our

00:37:25.030 --> 00:37:25.870
Great Sui army.

00:37:26.190 --> 00:37:27.280
Then how

00:37:29.510 --> 00:37:30.360
did North Qi

00:37:30.440 --> 00:37:32.190
obtain the design?

00:37:45.820 --> 00:37:47.220
(Qinxi Valley)

00:37:47.220 --> 00:37:48.220
Qinxi Valley

00:37:48.380 --> 00:37:49.660
is the Eldest Princess's garden.

00:37:50.380 --> 00:37:51.780
Unlike the outside chill,

00:37:52.100 --> 00:37:53.020
spring flowers

00:37:53.020 --> 00:37:54.220
bloom here now.

00:37:55.000 --> 00:37:56.020
If not for the Eldest Princess's

00:37:56.020 --> 00:37:57.180
special flower-viewing event,

00:37:57.540 --> 00:37:59.620
we wouldn't be allowed in

00:37:59.620 --> 00:38:00.460
to enjoy

00:38:00.660 --> 00:38:01.620
the blooms

00:38:01.620 --> 00:38:02.500
with you,

00:38:02.500 --> 00:38:03.700
Mr. Gu.

00:38:04.180 --> 00:38:05.120
You are considerate, Linlang.

00:38:07.780 --> 00:38:10.220
(Cao Yan, Minister of the Court
of Judicial Review; Young Master Sun)

00:38:11.900 --> 00:38:14.540
(Miss Zheng; Miss Zhou)

00:38:16.840 --> 00:38:17.880
Everyone in Huajing says

00:38:18.000 --> 00:38:19.880
Academician Gu is handsome and talented,

00:38:19.880 --> 00:38:21.200
(Wang Linlang, Daughter of Duke of Ning)
and

00:38:21.210 --> 00:38:22.760
now highly favored by court.

00:38:23.600 --> 00:38:24.440
You guys

00:38:24.840 --> 00:38:26.240
have been outshone.

00:38:27.560 --> 00:38:30.240
Academician Gu first won
the General's daughter's following,

00:38:30.680 --> 00:38:32.950
then the Duke of Ning's daughter's favor,

00:38:33.020 --> 00:38:33.860
such "luck"

00:38:34.220 --> 00:38:35.500
we truly envy.

00:38:36.580 --> 00:38:37.820
General Chu's daughter?

00:38:38.420 --> 00:38:39.500
I heard Lady Chu

00:38:39.500 --> 00:38:40.780
grew up on the frontier.

00:38:40.980 --> 00:38:41.860
In the army

00:38:42.020 --> 00:38:43.100
she never flaunted her status

00:38:43.220 --> 00:38:44.980
and joked freely with soldiers,

00:38:45.100 --> 00:38:46.540
ignoring gender taboos.

00:38:46.740 --> 00:38:48.420
It's almost unimaginable.

00:38:49.220 --> 00:38:50.340
I feel ashamed

00:38:50.340 --> 00:38:51.700
for General Chu.

00:38:54.540 --> 00:38:55.420
You lot!

00:38:55.740 --> 00:38:56.700
Don't go too far!

00:38:56.700 --> 00:38:57.580
Shut up!

00:38:57.580 --> 00:38:58.460
How rude!

00:38:58.740 --> 00:38:59.580
Whose maid are you?

00:38:59.780 --> 00:39:00.740
