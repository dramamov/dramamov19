Father!

Father!

Chun,

00:03:29.080 --> 00:03:30.310
you usually help Mother

00:03:30.310 --> 00:03:31.150
with the household

00:03:31.870 --> 00:03:32.910
and take care of our Chun'er.

00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:35.120
It's truly hard on you.

00:03:36.190 --> 00:03:37.680
Don't say that.

00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:39.630
I just hope

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:42.800
you can stay a little longer this time.

00:03:44.590 --> 00:03:45.430
Chun,

00:03:46.590 --> 00:03:47.870
I'm not leaving this time.

00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:50.640
I'll stay

00:03:51.190 --> 00:03:52.240
with you forever.

00:03:57.870 --> 00:03:58.710
Zhong,

00:03:58.960 --> 00:04:00.470
why are you leaving

00:04:00.470 --> 00:04:01.680
earlier than planned?

00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:05.280
The Wei family protects the nation.

00:04:06.030 --> 00:04:07.360
When there's war we must go.

00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:08.680
Don't worry,

00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:10.240
I'll return

00:04:10.520 --> 00:04:11.360
victorious.

00:04:11.630 --> 00:04:13.030
I'll await your safe return.

00:04:13.710 --> 00:04:14.630
No problem.

00:04:37.430 --> 00:04:39.310
Shu bought Chun jewelry.

00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:40.870
Buy me one too,

00:04:40.870 --> 00:04:41.710
okay?

00:04:44.510 --> 00:04:45.680
Hearing you makes

00:04:45.830 --> 00:04:47.270
my hand ache again.

00:04:49.190 --> 00:04:50.270
Shut up!

00:04:50.870 --> 00:04:51.800
I'll beat you up!

00:04:51.800 --> 00:04:52.640
Don't be mad.

00:04:52.830 --> 00:04:54.070
Don't be mad.

00:04:55.070 --> 00:04:56.360
When I return from the campaign

00:04:57.430 --> 00:04:58.560
I'll buy you one

00:04:59.120 --> 00:05:00.720
even better than Chun's.

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:13.750
I can't believe a blockhead like you

00:05:13.750 --> 00:05:14.920
actually got a wife.

00:05:17.510 --> 00:05:19.080
Take a bite, come on.

00:05:25.120 --> 00:05:25.960
You...

00:05:26.750 --> 00:05:27.590
You blockhead!

00:05:28.510 --> 00:05:29.350
Delicious.

00:05:32.120 --> 00:05:33.000
You're still smiling!

00:05:37.240 --> 00:05:38.510
You're annoying.

00:06:06.830 --> 00:06:07.680
If one day

00:06:07.680 --> 00:06:08.750
I don't return from the campaign,

00:06:10.800 --> 00:06:12.560
find your own life.

00:06:14.120 --> 00:06:14.960
Remarry

00:06:15.560 --> 00:06:16.680
or leave.

00:06:17.070 --> 00:06:17.920
Don't waste your youth

00:06:17.920 --> 00:06:19.270
stuck in the Wei household

00:06:20.870 --> 00:06:22.600
for my sake.

00:06:40.870 --> 00:06:41.710
Rong!

00:06:44.310 --> 00:06:45.430
I can see you,

00:06:46.430 --> 00:06:47.480
don't hide.

00:06:48.360 --> 00:06:49.200
Rong!

00:06:52.120 --> 00:06:52.960
Rong!

00:06:55.190 --> 00:06:56.720
Soon you'll be a father

00:06:56.720 --> 00:06:58.000
and still so childish.

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:00.840
Rong!

00:07:02.480 --> 00:07:03.510

Lan.

00:07:21.390 --> 00:07:23.560
I thought I'd never find you again.

00:07:42.680 --> 00:07:43.720
Lan,

00:07:45.510 --> 00:07:46.350
I'm...

00:07:46.480 --> 00:07:49.270
I'm afraid you'll never find me again.

00:08:27.430 --> 00:08:28.270

(Undying Loyalty)
Ancestors of the Wei family above,

00:08:41.390 --> 00:08:43.000
your descendants

00:08:43.150 --> 00:08:44.320
swear here:

00:08:45.030 --> 00:08:46.480
After decades of sharpening our swords,

00:08:46.960 --> 00:08:49.510
we will again slay North Qi's fiends,

00:08:50.200 --> 00:08:53.000
bring welfare to Great Sui's people,

00:08:53.360 --> 00:08:54.480
and protect our land

00:08:54.720 --> 00:08:55.870
until peace returns.

00:08:56.870 --> 00:08:58.360
We pray our ancestors

00:08:58.960 --> 00:09:01.390
bless us with a victorious return.

What's that smell?

00:10:41.510 --> 00:10:42.390
It's the granary!

00:10:42.390 --> 00:10:43.790
Water!

00:10:43.790 --> 00:10:44.630
Put out the fire!

00:10:45.120 --> 00:10:46.360
- Get water!
- There's fire!

00:10:46.360 --> 00:10:47.840
- This way!
- Someone help!

00:10:47.840 --> 00:10:48.680
Quick!

00:10:50.650 --> 00:10:51.550
Find more water!

00:10:51.550 --> 00:10:52.390
Put out the fire!

00:10:53.310 --> 00:10:54.200
Put it out!

00:10:54.200 --> 00:10:55.680
- Put the fire out!
- Bring water!

00:10:55.910 --> 00:10:57.350
- Hurry!
- Help!

00:10:57.840 --> 00:10:58.680
Over here!

00:10:59.000 --> 00:10:59.840
Be quick!

00:11:00.390 --> 00:11:01.230
Bring more people!

00:11:01.790 --> 00:11:02.630
Come on! Hurry!

00:11:03.130 --> 00:11:04.000
Make it quick!

00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:04.840
That way!

00:11:07.630 --> 00:11:08.470
Hurry!

00:11:09.750 --> 00:11:10.670
Get more water!

00:11:12.600 --> 00:11:14.030
- Here, here!
- This way!

00:11:14.030 --> 00:11:15.120
Carry what's not burning away!

00:11:15.120 --> 00:11:15.960
Quick!

00:11:17.750 --> 00:11:18.620
Give me a hand here!

00:11:18.630 --> 00:11:19.790
North Qi retreating to Baidi Valley

00:11:19.960 --> 00:11:21.290
should have kept them occupied.

00:11:21.390 --> 00:11:22.960
Why send men to burn our granary?

00:11:23.200 --> 00:11:24.480
Report!

00:11:27.150 --> 00:11:27.990
Young General,

00:11:28.120 --> 00:11:28.960
all our generals

00:11:28.960 --> 00:11:30.360
are trapped in Baidi Valley.

00:11:30.670 --> 00:11:31.870
Please send urgent rescue.

00:11:32.030 --> 00:11:33.600
Weren't we supposed to have the advantage?

00:11:33.600 --> 00:11:34.960
The intelligence was wrong.

00:11:35.360 --> 00:11:36.360
North Qi's forces

00:11:36.360 --> 00:11:37.510
are over four times

00:11:37.510 --> 00:11:38.350
our estimate.

00:11:38.510 --> 00:11:39.510
Our army is hard-pressed

00:11:39.510 --> 00:11:40.870
and cannot break out.

00:11:41.360 --> 00:11:43.000
Leave some to continue fighting the fire,

00:11:43.510 --> 00:11:44.350
the rest,

00:11:44.600 --> 00:11:46.000
follow me to reinforce Baidi Valley.

00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:47.320
- Yes!
- Young General!

00:12:49.080 --> 00:12:49.920
(Octagonal crossbow?)

00:13:38.030 --> 00:13:40.260
Charge!

00:13:40.260 --> 00:13:43.870
(Wei)
Charge!

00:13:47.440 --> 00:13:48.280
Jun!

00:14:41.480 --> 00:14:42.510
Protect the general!

00:14:42.840 --> 00:14:44.150
Brothers, come on!

00:14:45.510 --> 00:14:46.630
Jun.

00:14:56.720 --> 00:14:58.200
I told you to guard the camp,

00:14:59.600 --> 00:15:01.030
why didn't you listen?

00:15:02.080 --> 00:15:02.920
I...

00:15:04.480 --> 00:15:05.320
Jun.

00:16:01.060 --> 00:16:06.580
(Wei)

00:16:10.460 --> 00:16:15.180
(Wei)

00:16:16.420 --> 00:16:23.420
(Wei)

00:16:49.750 --> 00:16:50.590
And,

00:16:57.000 --> 00:16:58.750
there's a mole in the Arsenal Bureau.

00:17:00.510 --> 00:17:02.150
They gave the octagonal crossbow plans

00:17:02.150 --> 00:17:03.320
to North Qi.

00:17:06.510 --> 00:17:07.350
Find...

00:17:21.640 --> 00:17:22.750
Find him.

00:17:28.440 --> 00:17:29.310
Find him.

00:17:45.070 --> 00:17:46.000
Yun,

00:17:52.200 --> 00:17:53.040
I'm sorry.

00:17:55.590 --> 00:17:56.440
From now on

00:17:56.440 --> 00:17:57.680
we will leave you

00:17:59.440 --> 00:18:01.350
to face what comes alone.

00:18:03.920 --> 00:18:05.200
No, Jun!

00:18:06.880 --> 00:18:07.790
I'm sorry.

00:18:08.480 --> 00:18:09.320
No!

00:18:15.790 --> 00:18:16.630
No!

00:18:33.680 --> 00:18:34.520
Jun!

00:18:42.510 --> 00:18:43.350
Sir!

00:18:44.000 --> 00:18:45.200
The Marquis of Zhenguo has fallen!

00:18:46.350 --> 00:18:48.440
General Wei Shu has fallen!

00:18:49.440 --> 00:18:51.350
Captain Wei Qin has fallen!

00:18:52.510 --> 00:18:54.400
Captain Wei Feng has fallen!

00:18:55.590 --> 00:18:57.510
Deputy Captain Wei Ya has fallen!

00:18:58.750 --> 00:19:01.680
Deputy Captain Wei Rong has fallen!

00:19:57.830 --> 00:19:58.790
Retreat.

00:20:06.030 --> 00:20:07.480
Fall back to Tianshou Pass

00:20:07.880 --> 00:20:08.960
to prevent North Qi from

00:20:09.310 --> 00:20:10.750
attacking Huajing again.

00:20:11.400 --> 00:20:12.310
Yes!

00:20:40.900 --> 00:20:43.860
(Great Sui Imperial Palace)

00:20:50.270 --> 00:20:51.110
Father,

00:20:51.400 --> 00:20:53.640
this was not my fault.

00:20:54.400 --> 00:20:55.270
It... It was Wei Zhong.

00:20:55.270 --> 00:20:56.110
He was greedy for glory

00:20:56.240 --> 00:20:57.080
and reckless in pursuit.

00:20:57.400 --> 00:20:58.510
He ignored my advice

00:20:58.830 --> 00:20:59.830
and chased the fleeing enemy,

00:21:00.000 --> 00:21:01.200
falling right into North Qi's ambush.

00:21:01.200 --> 00:21:02.720
(Emperor Chunde of Great Sui)
He caused Great Sui

00:21:02.720 --> 00:21:04.050
to lose seventy thousand elite soldiers!

00:21:14.960 --> 00:21:15.800
Advice?

00:21:17.350 --> 00:21:18.880
How did you advice him?

00:21:21.000 --> 00:21:22.510
When Wei Zhong proposed the pursuit,

00:21:22.750 --> 00:21:24.310
I told him again and again:

00:21:24.680 --> 00:21:25.680
Never block a retreating army.

00:21:25.680 --> 00:21:26.520
Don't chase a cornered foe.

00:21:26.750 --> 00:21:27.590
But he...

00:21:28.200 --> 00:21:29.040
But he

00:21:29.240 --> 00:21:30.680
dismissed me

00:21:30.920 --> 00:21:32.070
as too young

00:21:32.070 --> 00:21:33.000
and inexperienced.

00:21:33.140 --> 00:21:34.000
General Yao...

00:21:34.000 --> 00:21:35.510
He can testify.

00:21:37.750 --> 00:21:38.590
Yao Yong,

00:21:40.160 --> 00:21:41.680
is this true?

00:21:50.310 --> 00:21:51.160
Your Majesty,

00:21:51.790 --> 00:21:52.920
every word His Highness said

00:21:53.240 --> 00:21:54.270
is true.

00:22:05.240 --> 00:22:06.240
Duke of Ning,

00:22:08.000 --> 00:22:09.110
in your view,

00:22:09.550 --> 00:22:10.960
is the Crown Prince blameless?

00:22:14.200 --> 00:22:15.040
Your Majesty,

00:22:16.110 --> 00:22:17.030
not entirely.

00:22:17.160 --> 00:22:19.020
(Wang Jingzhi, Duke of Ning)
His fault lies in

00:22:19.070 --> 00:22:20.920
lacking command authority

00:22:20.920 --> 00:22:22.000
as the Crown Prince.

00:22:22.790 --> 00:22:24.070
Though he saw danger,

00:22:24.070 --> 00:22:24.920
he failed to stop it.

00:22:26.750 --> 00:22:27.590
Yet, Your Majesty,

00:22:28.030 --> 00:22:29.830
His Highness

00:22:29.830 --> 00:22:30.680
is still young.

00:22:30.920 --> 00:22:32.030
That he could sense the danger

00:22:32.590 --> 00:22:34.000
is already rare.

00:22:44.510 --> 00:22:45.680
You are all dismissed.

00:22:47.790 --> 00:22:48.920
Father, please see my sincerity.

00:22:49.310 --> 00:22:50.550
I take my leave.

00:23:05.920 --> 00:23:06.760
My Lady!

00:23:08.070 --> 00:23:08.910
My Lady!

00:23:09.200 --> 00:23:10.200
The whole city's talking:

00:23:10.550 --> 00:23:11.790
the Wei army's been defeated,

00:23:12.030 --> 00:23:13.070
their entire clan wiped out.

00:23:14.270 --> 00:23:15.550
Seventy thousand soldiers perished

00:23:17.200 --> 00:23:18.040
in Baidi Valley!

00:23:18.880 --> 00:23:19.720
Their whole family

00:23:20.440 --> 00:23:21.280
are gone?

00:23:28.030 --> 00:23:28.880
My Lady,

00:23:28.880 --> 00:23:29.830
where are you going?

00:23:32.620 --> 00:23:35.660
(Best regards. Wei Jun)

00:23:39.060 --> 00:23:42.420
(Investigate the Arsenal Bureau.
Best regards. Wei Jun)

00:23:55.590 --> 00:23:57.400
Such loyal soldiers,

00:24:10.920 --> 00:24:12.070
pillars of the nation.

00:24:12.070 --> 00:24:14.070
Why is there no justice for them?

00:24:19.310 --> 00:24:21.510
Heaven has no eyes!

00:24:51.200 --> 00:24:52.040
Your Majesty,

00:24:52.510 --> 00:24:53.440
the loss of seventy thousand

00:24:53.680 --> 00:24:55.400
elite troops at Baidi Valley

00:24:55.640 --> 00:24:56.510
is catastrophic.

00:24:57.030 --> 00:24:58.550
The Crown Prince may be forgiven,

00:24:58.960 --> 00:24:59.830
but the Wei family

00:25:00.200 --> 00:25:01.480
cannot escape blame.

00:25:03.070 --> 00:25:04.480
Seven great generals

00:25:04.720 --> 00:25:05.830
have fallen.

00:25:06.200 --> 00:25:08.070
I know Your Majesty meant well,

00:25:08.750 --> 00:25:10.640
but the people won't understand.

00:25:11.400 --> 00:25:12.240
This morning,

00:25:12.440 --> 00:25:13.750
the Ministries of Rites,

00:25:14.000 --> 00:25:15.310
Revenue, and Personnel

00:25:15.310 --> 00:25:16.350
all came to discuss this matter.

00:25:16.590 --> 00:25:17.830
We know Your Majesty

00:25:17.830 --> 00:25:19.590
favors the Wei family too much.

00:25:20.110 --> 00:25:21.830
But people will think Your Majesty

00:25:22.070 --> 00:25:23.920
favors them too much.

00:25:24.160 --> 00:25:25.920
Public resentment will grow.

00:25:28.000 --> 00:25:28.840
And I heard

00:25:29.510 --> 00:25:30.790
the General Wei Yun returns

00:25:30.920 --> 00:25:32.150
to the capital today with the coffins.

00:25:32.680 --> 00:25:33.920
Your Majesty should

00:25:34.830 --> 00:25:36.070
decide soon.

00:25:41.920 --> 00:25:43.200
About the Wei family case,

00:25:44.640 --> 00:25:46.510
after the Marquis's burial, hand it over

00:25:47.350 --> 00:25:49.240
to the Court of Judicial Review.

00:25:50.270 --> 00:25:51.110
But...

00:25:52.160 --> 00:25:53.160
Duke of Ning,

00:25:57.270 --> 00:25:58.440
what say you?

00:26:01.550 --> 00:26:02.590
Wise decision, Your Majesty.

00:26:07.400 --> 00:26:08.270
I'm weary.

00:26:09.310 --> 00:26:10.200
You may leave.

00:26:25.550 --> 00:26:26.550
Does Great Sui

00:26:27.240 --> 00:26:28.240
no longer have soldiers

00:26:29.110 --> 00:26:30.510
who can guard our borders

00:26:30.510 --> 00:26:31.350
and resist the enemy?

00:26:33.680 --> 00:26:34.680
Must I truly

00:26:35.350 --> 00:26:37.830
make peace with North Qi?

00:26:38.790 --> 00:26:40.030
The Crown Prince is useless.

00:26:42.590 --> 00:26:44.200
What will become of

00:26:45.030 --> 00:26:46.510
Great Sui's future?

00:26:55.700 --> 00:26:58.460
(Marquis of Zhenguo's Mansion)

00:27:07.100 --> 00:27:10.820
(True Might)

00:27:10.820 --> 00:27:13.820
(Marquis of Zhenguo's Mansion)

00:27:34.070 --> 00:27:35.440
- Mother!
- Mother!

00:27:35.440 --> 00:27:36.390
(Marquis of Zhenguo's Mansion)

00:27:36.400 --> 00:27:37.150
Mother!

00:27:50.750 --> 00:27:52.480
Mother!

00:28:04.640 --> 00:28:05.830
I, Wei Yun,

00:28:07.350 --> 00:28:08.920
have returned with my father and brothers.

00:28:11.960 --> 00:28:12.800
Mother!

00:28:14.310 --> 00:28:15.150
Sisters!

00:28:17.920 --> 00:28:19.510
I'm sorry.

00:28:24.680 --> 00:28:25.520
Yun...

00:28:25.920 --> 00:28:27.320
- Mother.
- Rong!

00:28:27.790 --> 00:28:28.750
Yun.

00:28:29.590 --> 00:28:30.920
Yun.

00:28:32.400 --> 00:28:33.510
Mother!

00:28:36.000 --> 00:28:36.840
My husband

00:28:37.720 --> 00:28:38.790
and my sons

00:28:39.200 --> 00:28:41.000
died for Great Sui.

00:28:41.680 --> 00:28:42.960
They were heroes,

00:28:43.790 --> 00:28:46.400
true men of loyalty and honor!

00:28:48.790 --> 00:28:49.640
All of you...

00:28:50.920 --> 00:28:53.590
You did well.

00:28:55.380 --> 00:28:57.980
(Marquis of Zhenguo's Mansion)

00:28:58.000 --> 00:28:59.640
You did well!

00:28:59.640 --> 00:29:00.480
Brother Wei!

00:29:50.500 --> 00:29:57.300
(Marquis of Zhenguo's Mansion)

00:30:11.440 --> 00:30:12.590
Lady Chu, are you here

00:30:12.590 --> 00:30:13.640
to shame the Wei family?

00:30:14.590 --> 00:30:15.720
Before Wei Jun went to war,

00:30:17.070 --> 00:30:18.550
we secretly agreed we'd marry each other

00:30:19.830 --> 00:30:21.720
after he returns from the battlefield.

00:30:23.440 --> 00:30:24.590
Now that he's returned,

00:30:26.200 --> 00:30:27.240
I've come to fulfill our promise.

00:30:28.030 --> 00:30:29.790
My brother never

00:30:29.790 --> 00:30:30.830
told me about that.

00:30:31.070 --> 00:30:32.200
Then you don't know

00:30:33.240 --> 00:30:34.510
what passed between us.

00:30:41.230 --> 00:30:42.070
Thank you, Mother.

00:30:42.070 --> 00:30:42.910
Jun,

00:30:43.110 --> 00:30:44.110
I had hoped

00:30:44.240 --> 00:30:45.920
to see you wed this time.

00:30:46.200 --> 00:30:47.550
Once I return in victory,

00:30:47.920 --> 00:30:49.550
you will see me marry.

00:30:50.400 --> 00:30:51.830
You already have someone in mind?

00:30:52.030 --> 00:30:52.880
Mother,

00:30:52.880 --> 00:30:53.720
we'll talk

00:30:53.960 --> 00:30:54.800
after I return.

00:30:55.240 --> 00:30:56.110
Just wait for us.

00:30:58.830 --> 00:30:59.670
Yun,

00:31:00.110 --> 00:31:00.960
put down the sword.

00:31:12.790 --> 00:31:14.510
My son went to the afterlife alone.

00:31:15.200 --> 00:31:17.270
He failed you, Lady Chu.

00:31:18.590 --> 00:31:19.680
Please, go home.

00:31:26.000 --> 00:31:27.240
That day at the Spring Breeze House,

00:31:28.000 --> 00:31:29.200
I confessed to Wei Jun.

00:31:31.790 --> 00:31:33.790
Everyone mocked me for shamelessness,

00:31:34.830 --> 00:31:35.720
but only he

00:31:37.680 --> 00:31:39.640
understood my courage to love.

00:31:43.750 --> 00:31:44.680
Lady Chu,

00:31:45.550 --> 00:31:47.310
do you realize that if you marry him,

00:31:47.310 --> 00:31:48.270
you'll be a widow?

00:31:49.270 --> 00:31:51.200
Marriage is a lifelong matter,

00:31:51.750 --> 00:31:52.960
does your mother even know?

00:31:55.920 --> 00:31:56.760
Chu Yu!

00:31:57.680 --> 00:31:59.070
Where are you going dressed like that?

00:32:06.960 --> 00:32:07.920
I'm going to marry Wei Jun

00:32:08.480 --> 00:32:09.590
to fulfill our promise.

00:32:10.200 --> 00:32:11.200
After Baidi Valley,

00:32:11.400 --> 00:32:12.550
the Wei family's defeat

00:32:12.550 --> 00:32:14.270
dragged down seventy thousand men!

00:32:14.550 --> 00:32:15.680
The Wei family is ruined.

00:32:15.680 --> 00:32:16.720
What are you doing?

00:32:16.960 --> 00:32:17.800
I said before,

00:32:18.440 --> 00:32:19.880
this isn't just for me.

00:32:20.480 --> 00:32:21.680
No one will stop me today.

00:32:22.200 --> 00:32:23.040
Chu Yu!

00:32:23.350 --> 00:32:25.160
How long will you keep making a scene?

00:32:25.440 --> 00:32:26.680
Will you only stop

00:32:26.680 --> 00:32:27.920
once you've completely ruined

00:32:27.920 --> 00:32:29.110
the Chu family's name?

00:32:30.000 --> 00:32:30.840
Chu Linyang,

00:32:31.110 --> 00:32:32.350
why aren't you stopping your sister?

00:32:32.550 --> 00:32:34.070
She always listens to you.

00:32:37.400 --> 00:32:38.240
Linyang,

00:32:39.720 --> 00:32:40.750
I don't have a choice,

00:32:42.070 --> 00:32:43.270
at least not now.

00:32:54.680 --> 00:32:55.520
Mother,

00:32:57.240 --> 00:32:58.200
let her go.

00:33:06.030 --> 00:33:06.880
Chu Yu,

00:33:07.680 --> 00:33:08.590
if you dare step out

00:33:08.590 --> 00:33:10.070
of this house today,

00:33:10.680 --> 00:33:11.550
you are

00:33:12.720 --> 00:33:14.680
no longer of the Chu family.

00:33:41.310 --> 00:33:43.830
I've told my mother before coming.

00:33:45.830 --> 00:33:47.750
I know marriage is a serious matter,

00:33:48.030 --> 00:33:49.270
one decided by parents

00:33:49.400 --> 00:33:50.400
and matchmakers.

00:33:52.680 --> 00:33:53.750
But I, Chu Yu,

00:33:54.790 --> 00:33:55.630
will only

00:33:56.750 --> 00:33:58.510
follow my own heart in this life.

00:34:00.070 --> 00:34:01.070
Lady Chu,

00:34:02.070 --> 00:34:03.920
it's not that the Wei family won't accept you,

00:34:04.960 --> 00:34:07.200
but if you enter this house today,

00:34:08.280 --> 00:34:09.510
you'll be widowed.

00:34:10.510 --> 00:34:12.590
How could I bear that?

00:34:13.510 --> 00:34:14.710
Mrs. Wei, you were young once too,

00:34:15.710 --> 00:34:16.760
and you've known the pain

00:34:17.110 --> 00:34:18.070
of losing the one you love.

00:34:19.440 --> 00:34:20.590
You must understand

00:34:22.960 --> 00:34:23.880
how I feel now.

00:34:46.480 --> 00:34:47.320
Today,

00:34:47.920 --> 00:34:49.190
I swear by cutting my hair

00:34:50.000 --> 00:34:51.030
I marry Wei Jun,

00:34:51.630 --> 00:34:52.710
with no regrets, no remorse.

00:34:57.590 --> 00:34:58.510
From this day on,

00:34:59.480 --> 00:35:01.030
Wei Jun is my husband.

00:35:02.230 --> 00:35:03.480
If no one will mourn him,

00:35:03.960 --> 00:35:05.030
I will.

00:35:05.840 --> 00:35:07.070
If no one will live as his widow,

00:35:08.360 --> 00:35:09.550
I will.

00:35:12.030 --> 00:35:13.440
The first branch of the family still stands.

00:35:15.960 --> 00:35:18.110
If you refuse me entry today,

00:35:19.360 --> 00:35:21.000
I'll kneel here and never rise

00:35:22.710 --> 00:35:23.630
until Wei Jun

00:35:25.710 --> 00:35:27.000
is laid to rest.

00:35:32.510 --> 00:35:33.360
Wei Jun,

00:35:34.920 --> 00:35:36.070
I remember

00:35:36.960 --> 00:35:37.960
every promise we made.

00:35:40.550 --> 00:35:41.800
I will keep them.

00:35:42.880 --> 00:35:43.880
I must,

00:35:46.280 --> 00:35:47.360
and I will.

00:35:53.550 --> 00:35:54.400
Mother,

00:35:55.280 --> 00:35:56.320
everyone in Huajing

00:35:56.670 --> 00:35:58.280
knows of this by now.

00:35:58.920 --> 00:36:01.000
If we turn her away,

00:36:01.550 --> 00:36:02.840
her life will

00:36:02.840 --> 00:36:04.000
only be harder.

00:36:04.840 --> 00:36:06.150
Let her have this.

00:36:24.400 --> 00:36:25.400
Lady Chu,

00:36:26.320 --> 00:36:28.150
come inside and change your clothes.

00:36:28.440 --> 00:36:29.360
We'll discuss the rest

00:36:29.670 --> 00:36:31.280
after the burial.

00:36:33.630 --> 00:36:34.470
Mother,

00:36:35.190 --> 00:36:36.030
she's really not...

00:36:39.920 --> 00:36:40.760
Yun,

00:36:41.510 --> 00:36:42.350
take your father

00:36:43.360 --> 00:36:44.630
and brothers

00:36:45.710 --> 00:36:46.920
home first.

00:37:18.070 --> 00:37:19.440
Her Ladyship gifted you

00:37:19.440 --> 00:37:20.400
a new inkstone.

00:37:20.920 --> 00:37:22.030
I'll take this one out.

00:37:22.800 --> 00:37:23.640
Put it down.

00:37:33.150 --> 00:37:33.990
My Lord,

00:37:34.550 --> 00:37:36.000
Lady Chu went

00:37:36.000 --> 00:37:37.510
dressed in wedding clothes,

00:37:37.670 --> 00:37:38.920
married into the Wei family herself.

00:37:39.670 --> 00:37:41.480
Why are you still thinking about her?

00:37:43.510 --> 00:37:44.350
Leave me.

00:38:24.480 --> 00:38:25.400
Beat him!

00:38:25.400 --> 00:38:26.240
Beat him to death!

00:38:31.030 --> 00:38:32.000
Beat him to death!

00:38:34.630 --> 00:38:36.320
I said it, so what?

00:38:36.670 --> 00:38:37.590
I won't let anyone

00:38:37.590 --> 00:38:38.430
insult her!

00:38:38.440 --> 00:38:39.360
Keep hitting him!

00:38:41.070 --> 00:38:43.280
Harder!

00:38:53.150 --> 00:38:54.280
- Let's go!
- Go!

00:38:57.920 --> 00:38:58.760
They ran off!

00:39:01.400 --> 00:39:02.960
You always told me

00:39:03.360 --> 00:39:04.590
to treat others with courtesy,

00:39:04.800 --> 00:39:06.070
that a gentleman uses words, not fists.

00:39:06.070 --> 00:39:07.920
So why are you fighting today?

00:39:08.670 --> 00:39:09.590
They slandered you.

00:39:10.440 --> 00:39:12.070
How could I still cling to
"gentlemanly conduct"?

00:39:13.880 --> 00:39:15.350
That title means nothing if I can't defend you.

00:39:17.110 --> 00:39:18.190
In that case,

00:39:19.320 --> 00:39:20.360
if you truly want to protect me,

00:39:20.800 --> 00:39:21.670
I'll teach you martial arts.

00:39:48.800 --> 00:39:49.640
You're so skilled,

00:39:50.230 --> 00:39:51.190
why should I bother learning?

00:39:52.150 --> 00:39:52.990
How about this:

00:39:53.510 --> 00:39:54.350
you stay

00:39:54.550 --> 00:39:55.960
by my side always

00:39:56.840 --> 00:39:57.680
and protect me.

00:39:58.000 --> 00:39:58.840
Alright?

00:40:04.070 --> 00:40:04.910
Alright.

00:40:05.280 --> 00:40:06.230
From now on,

00:40:06.230 --> 00:40:07.360
I'll stay by your side

00:40:07.710 --> 00:40:08.590
and protect you for life.

00:40:14.670 --> 00:40:15.710
Here, a new inkstone for you.

00:40:16.150 --> 00:40:17.110
Your exams are near.

00:40:17.510 --> 00:40:18.920
May your words

00:40:18.920 --> 00:40:19.920
flow clearly,

00:40:19.920 --> 00:40:20.920
your mind stay calm,

00:40:20.920 --> 00:40:22.190
and your name reach the top of the list.

00:40:25.550 --> 00:40:26.400
Okay.

00:40:26.400 --> 00:40:28.230
I'll try to do that.

00:40:29.900 --> 00:40:32.820
(Chu)

00:40:34.070 --> 00:40:34.910
The "Chu" as in Chu Yu?

00:40:36.360 --> 00:40:37.670
Also as in Gu Chusheng.

00:40:46.180 --> 00:40:49.420
(Chu)

00:40:57.190 --> 00:40:58.030
Don't worry.

00:40:58.710 --> 00:40:59.710
I won't let you down.

00:41:12.510 --> 00:41:14.070
Tonight is our wedding night.

00:41:15.360 --> 00:41:16.590
Where are you going?

00:41:17.880 --> 00:41:18.880
We're both tired.

00:41:19.800 --> 00:41:20.640
Let's rest early.

00:41:24.960 --> 00:41:26.760
I'm never one to cling to the past.

00:41:27.440 --> 00:41:28.280
How do you know

00:41:28.760 --> 00:41:29.840
I came for you?

00:41:30.920 --> 00:41:31.760
Today

00:41:31.760 --> 00:41:32.960
I have come for

00:41:32.960 --> 00:41:33.960
Young General Wei Jun.

00:41:44.660 --> 00:41:48.220
(Marquis of Zhenguo's Mansion)

00:41:52.140 --> 00:41:59.140
(In Pines and Bamboos)

00:42:44.710 --> 00:42:45.550
Brother Wei,

00:42:47.000 --> 00:42:47.840
forgive me

00:42:47.850 --> 00:42:48.880
for entering the Wei household

00:42:48.880 --> 00:42:49.840
this way.

00:42:51.590 --> 00:42:52.630
This matter may be

00:42:52.630 --> 00:42:54.030
graver than we thought.

00:42:55.440 --> 00:42:56.320
But I promise you,

00:42:57.230 --> 00:42:58.590
once I uncover the truth,

00:42:59.800 --> 00:43:01.030
I'll leave and confess my guilt

00:43:01.440 --> 00:43:02.280
myself.

00:43:03.880 --> 00:43:04.720
Who's there?

00:43:05.630 --> 00:43:07.280
My Lady, it's me.

00:43:07.920 --> 00:43:08.880
Why are you here?

00:43:09.110 --> 00:43:10.550
Lord Linyang sent me.

00:43:10.760 --> 00:43:11.960
He said you shouldn't

00:43:11.960 --> 00:43:13.190
face all this alone.

00:43:14.000 --> 00:43:14.880
My Lady,

00:43:15.150 --> 00:43:16.670
why did you leave me behind?

00:43:17.000 --> 00:43:17.840
Didn't I say

00:43:17.840 --> 00:43:19.190
I'd follow you

00:43:19.190 --> 00:43:20.360
through fire and blades?

00:43:20.760 --> 00:43:21.880
Look at you!

00:43:22.630 --> 00:43:23.710
You want to suffer with me?

00:43:25.320 --> 00:43:26.510
Whether it's pain or joy,

00:43:26.800 --> 00:43:28.400
wherever you are, My Lady,

00:43:28.400 --> 00:43:29.280
that's where I'll be.

00:43:37.510 --> 00:43:38.350
Alright then.

00:43:38.630 --> 00:43:39.710
I'm going to the mourning hall.

00:43:39.710 --> 00:43:40.550
You

00:43:40.880 --> 00:43:41.720
stay here.

00:43:42.880 --> 00:43:44.710
You're leaving me behind again.

00:43:56.800 --> 00:43:57.840
Lady Chun!

00:43:58.670 --> 00:43:59.760
Lady Chun!

00:44:00.670 --> 00:44:01.510
My Lady!

00:44:01.510 --> 00:44:02.510
No, My Lady!

00:44:02.670 --> 00:44:03.510
