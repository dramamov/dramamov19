00:00:55.640 --> 00:00:56.520
Marquis.

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:57.920
Marquis, help me.

00:00:58.470 --> 00:01:00.070
Please, Marquis.

00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:01.600
Keep your hands off me.

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:02.560
You disgust me.

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:04.430
It's not like that.

00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:05.640
He forced me.

00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:07.150
Marquis, please seek justice for me.

00:01:07.230 --> 00:01:08.510
You must kill him.

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:10.430
He forced you?

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:12.280
If you were unwilling,

00:01:12.790 --> 00:01:14.070
why didn't you choose death?

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:36.350
Marquis.

00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:38.310
Marquis, help me.

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:40.280
Disgusting.

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:43.760
Get rid of them.

00:01:44.230 --> 00:01:46.480
Be sure this never spreads.

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:47.870
Don't worry, Mother.

00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:50.200
I will handle this.

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:52.560
It's your birthday today.

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:54.280
We must plan how to handle

00:01:54.430 --> 00:01:56.200
that wretch Xu Wanning.

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:17.030
She brought in a crowd of low-class.

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:17.870
How absurd.

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:19.590
Feng,

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:21.080
sit down.

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:27.310
I didn't expect to attend
the birthday banquet here.

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:30.030
Lady Cui is giving too much honor
to us commoners.

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:31.080
Everyone, am I right?

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:32.030
That's right.

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:35.630
A few days ago, my mother-in-law said

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:38.080
she'd host a feast for everyone in the city.

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:39.960
She's true to her word.

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:43.840
As the mansion is rather small,

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:46.590
we can't receive more guests.

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:48.800
But my mother-in-law said

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:51.120
anyone unable to attend today

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:53.310
will receive five taels of silver

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:55.360
from her personal savings.

00:02:57.870 --> 00:02:58.960
Right, Mother?

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:02.680
Yes.

00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:05.520
- Great!
- Yes!

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:07.470
Have some more.

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:10.630
This is so tasty.

00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:20.680
Mother, what's wrong?

00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:23.840
I may not have slept well last night.

00:03:24.240 --> 00:03:26.000
I do feel a bit dizzy right now.

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:27.520
Mother,

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:29.150
today is your birthday.

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:30.680
You must not fall ill.

00:03:37.520 --> 00:03:38.390
Wanning,

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:41.190
why don't you take Mother to rest?

00:03:41.510 --> 00:03:42.710
I'll entertain the guests here.

00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:45.030
All right, Yunfeng.

00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:46.750
I'll go with you right now.

00:03:47.470 --> 00:03:50.150
Bring me to the shrine chamber
for a recitation.

00:03:51.960 --> 00:03:52.800
Mother,

00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:55.430
you should lie down and rest.

00:03:55.870 --> 00:03:58.280
Just do as I say.

00:03:58.840 --> 00:03:59.800
All right, Mother.

00:04:31.070 --> 00:04:33.510
Mother, you're not feeling dizzy now?

00:04:39.950 --> 00:04:41.390
Once I'm here,

00:04:42.720 --> 00:04:44.920
I feel entirely better.

00:04:46.920 --> 00:04:48.040
Since you're fine,

00:04:48.510 --> 00:04:50.560
I won't disturb you.

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:10.630
The stupefying incense is indeed strong.

00:05:11.190 --> 00:05:13.870
Good thing we took the antidote beforehand.

00:05:14.750 --> 00:05:15.680
Lin,

00:05:16.560 --> 00:05:18.240
she is in your hands now.

00:05:18.390 --> 00:05:19.270
Do not worry, Madam.

00:05:29.270 --> 00:05:30.750
Is it comfortable lying on the floor?

00:05:36.240 --> 00:05:37.080
Thank you.

00:05:38.240 --> 00:05:40.430
Fortunately,
Mohan replaced the incense in advance.

00:05:41.750 --> 00:05:42.800
Do you know

00:05:43.010 --> 00:05:45.080
Lady Cui secludes herself
to chant Buddhist sutras

00:05:45.130 --> 00:05:46.240
on the 1st and 15th monthly?

00:05:47.190 --> 00:05:48.030
Yes,

00:05:48.160 --> 00:05:49.310
she does have that habit.

00:05:50.240 --> 00:05:52.600
Do you think that's suspicious?

00:05:53.430 --> 00:05:54.360
A man shows up

00:05:54.630 --> 00:05:56.190
at the shrine chamber

00:05:56.750 --> 00:05:58.120
on those days.

00:05:59.600 --> 00:06:00.560
What's your plan?

00:06:02.870 --> 00:06:05.390
Give them a taste of their own medicine.

00:06:09.870 --> 00:06:10.720
Listen,

00:06:10.830 --> 00:06:12.630
take good care of my mother.

00:06:19.190 --> 00:06:20.030
Yunfeng.

00:06:23.120 --> 00:06:23.960
You…

00:06:24.800 --> 00:06:25.830
What's wrong, Yunfeng?

00:06:27.120 --> 00:06:28.190
You... How could you…?

00:06:28.510 --> 00:06:31.480
They came to check on Mother.

00:06:35.120 --> 00:06:36.870
Is something wrong with Mother?

00:07:04.310 --> 00:07:05.830
I believed

00:07:06.510 --> 00:07:08.310
you met him twice a month

00:07:09.310 --> 00:07:11.750
to discuss the Hongzhen Incense business.

00:07:12.950 --> 00:07:14.600
Only when I questioned him

00:07:15.240 --> 00:07:17.270
did I learn of your shameful act.

00:07:17.560 --> 00:07:18.750
Shameful?

00:07:19.310 --> 00:07:20.510
I've been a widow

00:07:20.510 --> 00:07:21.680
since your father passed.

00:07:21.920 --> 00:07:24.040
I don't see anything wrong with it.

00:07:29.630 --> 00:07:30.750
Very well.

00:07:33.720 --> 00:07:34.560
Mother,

00:07:35.310 --> 00:07:37.070
you see no fault in your actions.

00:07:37.920 --> 00:07:40.190
But is this the result you wanted?

00:07:42.120 --> 00:07:43.750
The reputation of the Cui family

00:07:43.920 --> 00:07:45.120
is now completely ruined.

00:07:47.120 --> 00:07:49.310
And forget about the First-Rank Lady title.

00:07:51.920 --> 00:07:53.360
As for Xu Wanning

00:07:53.950 --> 00:07:55.950
and that so-called Master Physician,

00:07:56.560 --> 00:07:57.750
neither of them

00:07:58.240 --> 00:08:00.000
will get out of this alive.

00:08:00.800 --> 00:08:01.750
And him as well.

00:08:03.720 --> 00:08:05.680
This man has now been exposed.

00:08:05.870 --> 00:08:08.310
In order not to affect
the Hongzhen Incense business,

00:08:10.510 --> 00:08:11.870
this man cannot be kept alive.

00:08:15.070 --> 00:08:16.430
Deal with him as you see fit.

00:08:22.270 --> 00:08:23.360
May Buddha have mercy.

00:08:33.720 --> 00:08:34.790
Marquis.

00:08:46.390 --> 00:08:47.240
Ma Si,

00:08:48.030 --> 00:08:49.510
where are you going?

00:08:50.240 --> 00:08:51.080
Marquis,

00:08:51.450 --> 00:08:53.340
Bai Qingqing in the water dungeon is missing.

00:08:53.420 --> 00:08:54.740
I was just about to report to you.

00:09:20.480 --> 00:09:21.480
Xu Wanning,

00:09:21.960 --> 00:09:24.030
the corpse of Ma Si

00:09:24.120 --> 00:09:26.320
clutched your earring.

00:09:26.550 --> 00:09:28.120
With such solid evidence,

00:09:28.510 --> 00:09:30.480
will you confess or not?

00:09:30.870 --> 00:09:32.270
I didn't do it.

00:09:32.270 --> 00:09:33.240
What is there to confess?

00:09:34.840 --> 00:09:36.480
Still trying to argue?

00:09:37.440 --> 00:09:38.320
Your Honor,

00:09:38.630 --> 00:09:40.630
my earring went missing two days ago.

00:09:40.790 --> 00:09:43.000
Maybe the culprit used my earring
to frame me.

00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:46.440
Then tell me, who is the murderer?

00:09:47.840 --> 00:09:49.180
If I could figure that out,

00:09:49.230 --> 00:09:50.550
why would we need a magistrate?

00:09:50.630 --> 00:09:51.470
How dare you?

00:09:51.870 --> 00:09:53.240
(Justice Presides)
Confess now,

00:09:53.240 --> 00:09:54.390
or be prepared for torture.

00:10:01.030 --> 00:10:01.960
Your Honor.

00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:03.840
Wanning,

00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:05.120
if this was your doing,

00:10:05.120 --> 00:10:06.120
just confess now.

00:10:06.630 --> 00:10:07.840
So you can avoid punishment.

00:10:08.440 --> 00:10:09.510
If you go to jail,

00:10:09.630 --> 00:10:10.670
I promise I'll get you out.

00:10:17.270 --> 00:10:20.390
Fine. Since you won't confess,

00:10:21.150 --> 00:10:22.550
I'll give you thirty blows to start.

00:10:22.790 --> 00:10:23.670
As a magistrate,

00:10:23.840 --> 00:10:25.120
you can't tell right from wrong.

00:10:25.120 --> 00:10:26.270
It's a disaster for public.

00:10:26.790 --> 00:10:27.960
Strike her!

00:10:30.750 --> 00:10:31.720
Hold on.

00:10:57.120 --> 00:10:58.000
Lady Xu.

00:11:03.910 --> 00:11:04.750
How audacious!

00:11:05.080 --> 00:11:06.440
Who are you?

00:11:08.860 --> 00:11:11.100
(Jinlin Guards)

00:11:17.440 --> 00:11:19.910
Greetings, Commander Pei.

00:11:20.270 --> 00:11:21.240
What?

00:11:21.370 --> 00:11:22.890
He's the Commander of Jinlin Guards?

00:11:28.600 --> 00:11:29.670
I wonder

00:11:30.150 --> 00:11:32.200
what brings you here,

00:11:32.840 --> 00:11:35.120
Commander Pei.

00:11:38.790 --> 00:11:39.910
Nothing much.

00:11:41.910 --> 00:11:43.270
I just had some free time

00:11:43.790 --> 00:11:44.910
and was curious

00:11:45.320 --> 00:11:46.910
how Magistrate Liu handles a case.

00:11:50.910 --> 00:11:52.080
Please proceed.

00:11:54.030 --> 00:11:54.960
Commander,

00:11:55.080 --> 00:11:56.150
this case

00:11:57.240 --> 00:11:59.270
requires further investigation.

00:11:59.440 --> 00:12:00.280
Huh?

00:12:01.720 --> 00:12:03.320
Rushing to pass sentence

00:12:03.870 --> 00:12:05.320
before the facts are clear?

00:12:06.600 --> 00:12:07.510
Could it be

00:12:07.930 --> 00:12:08.960
that you've taken a bribe?

00:12:10.510 --> 00:12:11.870
I wouldn't dare.

00:12:16.870 --> 00:12:18.000
Whether you have or not,

00:12:18.480 --> 00:12:19.840
I'll find out for myself.

00:12:21.120 --> 00:12:22.270
I wonder what your verdict is

00:12:22.790 --> 00:12:23.910
on this case,

00:12:27.270 --> 00:12:28.630
Magistrate Liu.

00:12:29.960 --> 00:12:33.000
I'll follow whatever you command.

00:12:35.390 --> 00:12:36.910
I believe

00:12:37.080 --> 00:12:38.120
Lady Xu

00:12:38.870 --> 00:12:40.120
is innocent in this case.

00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:43.960
Just release her.

00:12:44.270 --> 00:12:45.910
I'll release her at once.

00:12:53.600 --> 00:12:55.000
I apologize for my ignorance.

00:12:55.320 --> 00:12:58.440
I had no idea the Commander
of Jinlin Guards has

00:12:58.870 --> 00:13:00.320
been a guest in my mansion.

00:13:01.200 --> 00:13:02.440
However,

00:13:02.750 --> 00:13:04.840
I would never cover for kin.

00:13:05.240 --> 00:13:07.630
That earring is solid evidence.

00:13:08.080 --> 00:13:10.320
Xu Wanning cannot exonerate herself.

00:13:10.720 --> 00:13:13.510
Are you going to cast aside evidence and law

00:13:13.630 --> 00:13:15.120
and pass judgment privately?

00:13:17.670 --> 00:13:18.910
Lady Cui, it seems

00:13:19.790 --> 00:13:22.750
you can't wait
to have your own family jailed.

What if I insist that Lady Xu is innocent?

00:13:40.910 --> 00:13:43.030
Then please, Commander, show us your proof.

00:13:43.720 --> 00:13:47.550
So that no one can accuse us
for harboring a murderer.

00:13:49.440 --> 00:13:50.360
I have a witness.

00:13:52.150 --> 00:13:54.000
I can bear witness for Madam.

00:13:56.720 --> 00:13:58.360
I can bear witness for Madam.

00:13:58.720 --> 00:14:00.840
She is not the one who killed him.
