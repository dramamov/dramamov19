00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:33.560
Don't go forward.

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:35.719
It's not safe ahead.

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:03.719
Haven't you been here before?

00:02:33.039 --> 00:02:34.199
Don't go forward.

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:35.960
It's not safe ahead.

00:02:38.639 --> 00:02:39.120
Auntie.

00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:43.199
What did you just say?

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:45.520
Don't go forward.

00:02:45.879 --> 00:02:47.199
It's not safe ahead.

00:03:01.039 --> 00:03:02.199
Don't go forward.

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:04.000
It's not safe ahead.

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:16.240
This place again.

00:03:27.479 --> 00:03:29.000
Don't go forward.

00:03:29.719 --> 00:03:31.240
It's not safe ahead.

00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:33.159
Don't go forward.

00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:34.520
It's not safe ahead.

00:03:55.120 --> 00:03:56.639
Who... who are you?

00:03:57.400 --> 00:03:58.280
I am you.

00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:01.400
Have fun.

00:04:03.719 --> 00:04:05.240
Soon I'll replace you.

00:04:08.080 --> 00:04:08.919
Where are you going?

00:04:10.479 --> 00:04:10.960
Master.

00:04:13.879 --> 00:04:14.639
Is anyone there?

00:04:17.759 --> 00:04:19.360
Why is Grandpa taking so long this time?

00:04:20.759 --> 00:04:22.439
Old Ge, has Grandpa returned?

00:04:22.639 --> 00:04:23.240
Miss.

00:04:23.399 --> 00:04:25.160
Bai Ye returned last night.

00:04:25.480 --> 00:04:27.279
But he's been staying in his room.

00:04:27.519 --> 00:04:28.759
Says he caught a chill.

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:30.560
Miss.

00:04:30.920 --> 00:04:32.519
Bai Ye doesn't want to see anyone.

00:04:32.639 --> 00:04:33.839
Says he'll be fine after sleeping.

00:04:35.959 --> 00:04:36.879
Did Bai Ye say anything else?

00:04:38.480 --> 00:04:39.040
Nothing.

00:04:40.920 --> 00:04:41.360
Alright.

00:04:41.920 --> 00:04:42.839
Go about your business, Old Ge.

00:04:57.279 --> 00:04:58.560
Bai Ye, it's me.

00:04:59.639 --> 00:05:00.480
I heard you're ill.

00:05:00.720 --> 00:05:02.680
Xiaowei made your favorite porridge.

00:05:03.199 --> 00:05:04.319
Would you like some while it's hot?

00:05:06.959 --> 00:05:07.759
No need.

00:05:08.639 --> 00:05:10.160
My chill is quite severe.

00:05:10.519 --> 00:05:12.079
Don't want to infect you.

00:05:13.879 --> 00:05:15.360
Not eating won't help.

00:05:16.079 --> 00:05:16.680
How about this.

00:05:17.079 --> 00:05:18.079
I'll leave it by the door.

00:05:18.360 --> 00:05:19.240
Remember to take it later.

00:05:43.600 --> 00:05:44.040
Laifu.

00:05:47.240 --> 00:05:47.680
You.

00:05:48.279 --> 00:05:49.480
What are you doing here?

00:05:50.439 --> 00:05:50.839
Nothing.

00:05:52.480 --> 00:05:55.240
I'm going to get medicine for Grandpa.

00:05:55.759 --> 00:05:56.839
Come with me.

00:05:58.759 --> 00:06:01.079
Grandpa can't stay like this.

00:06:03.680 --> 00:06:04.120
Alright.

00:06:32.759 --> 00:06:33.319
Bai Ye.

00:06:33.759 --> 00:06:35.040
I left dinner by your door.

00:06:35.240 --> 00:06:36.639
Xiaowei got you special

00:06:36.839 --> 00:06:37.600
medicine for chills.

00:06:38.600 --> 00:06:39.759
Remember to take it.

00:07:34.040 --> 00:07:34.519
Bai Ye.

00:07:35.439 --> 00:07:36.600
Are you feeling better?

00:07:37.319 --> 00:07:38.319
A bit better.

00:07:41.879 --> 00:07:43.079
Where are you going?

00:07:44.279 --> 00:07:45.519
To cleanse myself.

00:07:46.199 --> 00:07:47.639
You must be feverish.

00:07:48.319 --> 00:07:49.319
The toilet's over there.

00:07:49.920 --> 00:07:50.519
Perhaps

00:07:51.439 --> 00:07:52.399
I'll take you.

00:07:53.959 --> 00:07:55.560
No need, young master.

00:08:12.279 --> 00:08:13.680
You dared to drug Grandpa?

00:08:14.079 --> 00:08:15.560
Aren't you afraid he'll punish you?

00:08:16.720 --> 00:08:18.040
Let me finish!

00:08:21.040 --> 00:08:22.639
I put laxative in his food,

00:08:23.399 --> 00:08:25.319
but antidote in his medicine.

00:08:26.079 --> 00:08:26.879
He went at midnight,

00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:28.639
so he ate but didn't take medicine.

00:08:30.319 --> 00:08:31.319
Meaning?

00:08:34.679 --> 00:08:35.519
He's faking illness.

00:08:36.240 --> 00:08:37.559
Grandpa's too old

00:08:38.399 --> 00:08:39.360
to fake illness. Why?

00:08:40.080 --> 00:08:41.440
To hide something.

00:08:43.200 --> 00:08:45.159
And he seems unfamiliar here.

00:08:47.440 --> 00:08:48.519
Meaning?

00:08:48.720 --> 00:08:50.000
I watched Bai Ye carefully.

00:08:51.159 --> 00:08:52.279
I noticed he

00:08:52.840 --> 00:08:54.399
eats and carries lanterns

00:08:55.039 --> 00:08:56.159
with his right hand.

00:09:00.600 --> 00:09:02.240
Grandpa's left-handed.

00:09:02.440 --> 00:09:03.919
So he's hiding

00:09:04.120 --> 00:09:06.039
to avoid contact with us.

00:09:06.240 --> 00:09:07.159
To not get exposed.

00:09:08.320 --> 00:09:09.159
You mean

00:09:10.360 --> 00:09:11.159
my grandpa

00:09:12.080 --> 00:09:13.120
isn't my grandpa?

00:09:13.559 --> 00:09:15.000
We need to investigate.

00:09:15.519 --> 00:09:16.200
How?

00:09:17.039 --> 00:09:19.480
Did Bai Ye say where he went?

00:09:20.600 --> 00:09:23.240
Grandpa mentioned

00:09:23.759 --> 00:09:24.919
he was investigating a case.

00:09:37.919 --> 00:09:38.799
Checked the database.

00:09:39.240 --> 00:09:41.000
There's a case related to what you mentioned.

00:09:41.879 --> 00:09:42.600
One month ago,

00:09:42.879 --> 00:09:44.440
a girl named Hui Xin filed a report.

00:09:45.200 --> 00:09:47.120
She said her boyfriend Zhang Hua

00:09:47.279 --> 00:09:48.879
was completely different after his business trip.

00:09:49.919 --> 00:09:50.840
She even claimed

00:09:51.240 --> 00:09:52.720
the original Zhang Hua had died.

00:09:53.720 --> 00:09:55.200
All information about this case

00:09:55.879 --> 00:09:56.519
is here.

00:09:58.000 --> 00:09:59.200
When we investigated,

00:09:59.360 --> 00:10:01.799
some said Zhang Hua might've been possessed by an Ashen Shade.

00:10:03.879 --> 00:10:04.799
But I think

00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:06.440
that's complete nonsense.

00:10:09.879 --> 00:10:10.919
Did she mention

00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:13.679
how Zhang Hua was different?

00:10:14.279 --> 00:10:15.320
Changed preferences,

00:10:15.639 --> 00:10:17.320
altered memories,

00:10:18.120 --> 00:10:20.799
and completely different daily routines.

00:10:21.799 --> 00:10:23.399
Exactly like Bai Ye's condition.

00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:26.679
You leave first.

00:10:27.600 --> 00:10:28.679
I need to talk with Laifu.

00:10:29.879 --> 00:10:30.879
That's my grandfather!

00:10:31.200 --> 00:10:32.320
Why can't I listen?

00:10:33.320 --> 00:10:34.279
It doesn't concern you.

00:10:45.720 --> 00:10:47.279
Fine, I'm leaving.

00:10:55.759 --> 00:10:56.320
Speak.

00:10:56.960 --> 00:10:57.639
What do you want to say?

00:11:04.720 --> 00:11:05.559
Previously,

00:11:06.679 --> 00:11:08.200
that Tu Teng you asked me to investigate...

00:11:08.960 --> 00:11:09.720
I have findings.

00:11:12.159 --> 00:11:13.559
But the deeper I looked,

00:11:15.159 --> 00:11:16.320
the more I realized at my level,

00:11:17.399 --> 00:11:19.519
the information I can access is very limited.

00:11:21.559 --> 00:11:23.080
What you're planning to do

00:11:24.759 --> 00:11:25.919
could be very dangerous.

00:11:26.960 --> 00:11:27.799
As a friend,

00:11:28.799 --> 00:11:29.759
I advise against it.

00:11:33.159 --> 00:11:35.039
I could hire you as a special consultant.

00:11:35.519 --> 00:11:36.799
You'd be set for life.

00:11:37.519 --> 00:11:38.279
Why must you

00:11:39.120 --> 00:11:40.279
insist on involving yourself

00:11:40.320 --> 00:11:41.919
in something potentially fatal?

00:11:44.120 --> 00:11:44.799
Officer Gu,

00:11:47.240 --> 00:11:48.919
everyone has their own destiny.

00:11:49.600 --> 00:11:50.440
I have mine.

00:11:51.120 --> 00:11:52.159
Bai Ye showed me kindness.

00:11:53.879 --> 00:11:54.799
These Tu Teng

00:11:57.080 --> 00:11:58.840
are connected to my family's death.

00:12:00.360 --> 00:12:01.519
There's blood debt here.

00:12:02.919 --> 00:12:05.039
Be it man, ghost or spirit,

00:12:06.960 --> 00:12:08.080
debts will be repaid,

00:12:09.399 --> 00:12:10.600
wrongs will be righted.

00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:46.120
What exactly is the truth?
