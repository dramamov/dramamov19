00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:59.520
(This is a work of fiction)

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:04.200
You're back.

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:18.280
Thank you.

00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:26.120
It's nothing.

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:41.680
Don't worry.

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:44.240
I relayed what you wanted to say.

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:47.840
But he didn't say anything.

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:51.480
It's okay. It's been so long.

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:53.200
It's not that important anymore.

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:19.880
We should have completed this level.

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:35.080
What do you think the next level is?

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:37.359
But it doesn't matter.

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:38.800
We're so incredible now.

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:41.040
We'll deal with it as we go.

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:43.640
Chen Jia Wen, toughen up.

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:45.560
You're a genius.

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:12.840
Are you mad?

00:03:14.320 --> 00:03:15.320
Who would I be mad at?

00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:17.360
At you?

00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:22.000
If you have something to say,

00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:24.760
just say it.

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:30.840
What do you want me to say?

00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:32.360
What are you thinking?

00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:34.440
Just say what's on your mind.

00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:35.880
I have nothing to say.

00:03:48.240 --> 00:03:49.280
I hate it the most
when you're like this.

00:03:51.800 --> 00:03:52.800
Suit yourself.

00:04:21.080 --> 00:04:22.680
Since you're not over Xu Yuan,

00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:27.480
why did you get together
with me back then?

00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:34.680
Chen Jia Wen.

00:04:36.280 --> 00:04:37.520
We've been together for four years.

00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:40.040
You still don't trust me.

00:05:25.720 --> 00:05:26.960
Which girl did you dream of?

00:05:28.080 --> 00:05:29.280
Princess?

00:05:32.160 --> 00:05:34.680
(Honorary Certificate)

00:05:38.080 --> 00:05:39.080
This is the university dorm?

00:06:02.320 --> 00:06:03.320
Song Lu!

00:06:03.320 --> 00:06:04.320
What's up?

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:06.000
What's the matter?

00:06:09.320 --> 00:06:10.520
You're so young too.

00:06:13.840 --> 00:06:14.840
What year in college are we in?

00:06:15.800 --> 00:06:16.800
What year is it?

00:06:16.800 --> 00:06:17.800
What's the date?

00:06:18.960 --> 00:06:20.280
It's May 21st.

00:06:20.560 --> 00:06:21.560
May 21st?

00:06:21.880 --> 00:06:22.880
May 21st.

00:06:22.960 --> 00:06:23.960
May 21st!

00:06:26.960 --> 00:06:27.960
Zhao.

00:06:30.760 --> 00:06:31.960
I've been reborn!

00:06:32.440 --> 00:06:34.600
I knew there would be
a level like this.

00:06:36.400 --> 00:06:37.400
Did you miss me, dude?

00:06:38.800 --> 00:06:39.840
Are you crazy?

00:06:40.720 --> 00:06:41.720
It's May 21st!

00:06:42.160 --> 00:06:43.160
I finally got to the next day!

00:06:43.920 --> 00:06:46.119
It's finally the next day!
I've been reborn...

00:06:46.120 --> 00:06:47.200
Stop...

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:49.040
Tell me what happened to you.

00:06:52.760 --> 00:06:53.760
It's a long story.

00:06:54.880 --> 00:06:55.880
And?

00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:57.000
And...

00:06:57.880 --> 00:06:59.800
James is finally
playing with his son...

00:07:00.440 --> 00:07:02.640
on the Lakers team.

00:07:05.040 --> 00:07:06.040
Get out of here.

00:07:06.041 --> 00:07:07.399
What level is James' son?

00:07:07.400 --> 00:07:08.920
He can't even beat me.
How can he play in the NBA?

00:07:09.040 --> 00:07:10.719
I know it sounds crazy.

00:07:10.720 --> 00:07:11.720
You have to believe me.

00:07:11.720 --> 00:07:12.720
No.

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:15.000
I believe you.

00:07:17.720 --> 00:07:19.040
Actually, I've always believed...

00:07:19.680 --> 00:07:22.200
that a more advanced civilization
exists in the universe.

00:07:24.600 --> 00:07:25.600
Chen.

00:07:25.601 --> 00:07:26.960
You are the legendary...

00:07:27.280 --> 00:07:28.680
- Chosen One.
- Chosen One.

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:33.000
I am.

00:07:34.040 --> 00:07:35.040
As if.

00:07:35.080 --> 00:07:36.879
Stop it.

00:07:36.880 --> 00:07:38.720
Did studying make you stupid?

00:07:39.120 --> 00:07:40.680
What's with all that nonsense?

00:07:41.280 --> 00:07:43.120
Just go to sleep.
We have an 8am class tomorrow.

00:07:45.440 --> 00:07:46.440
Why sleep?

00:07:47.120 --> 00:07:48.760
I'm finally back.

00:07:49.400 --> 00:07:50.560
Let's go out and have fun.

00:08:49.720 --> 00:08:50.720
Lu Lu.

00:08:55.360 --> 00:08:56.360
Lu Lu.

00:09:02.120 --> 00:09:04.240
It's 3am.

00:09:05.320 --> 00:09:06.799
What's wrong?

00:09:06.800 --> 00:09:08.360
Are we going to sleep or not?

00:09:09.200 --> 00:09:10.280
I can't sleep.

00:09:11.320 --> 00:09:13.640
What do you want?

00:09:14.920 --> 00:09:15.920
Come watch the sunrise with me.

00:09:17.120 --> 00:09:18.640
Benevolence, righteousness,
propriety, wisdom, trustworthiness,

00:09:18.800 --> 00:09:20.120
gentleness, kindness,
respectfulness, frugality, humility.

00:09:20.680 --> 00:09:21.959
We have school tomorrow.

00:09:21.960 --> 00:09:22.960
We can't drink anymore.

00:09:23.280 --> 00:09:24.280
Zhao.

00:09:25.480 --> 00:09:27.000
Don't go yet.
Let me ask you something.

00:09:27.640 --> 00:09:28.640
Go ahead.

00:09:32.520 --> 00:09:33.839
You knew about Xu Yuan.

00:09:33.840 --> 00:09:34.920
Why didn't you tell me?

00:09:38.880 --> 00:09:39.880
Well...

00:09:40.280 --> 00:09:41.800
It's not a big deal.

00:09:53.400 --> 00:09:54.720
Then I'll punish you. Do you accept?

00:09:58.720 --> 00:10:00.480
How did you find this place?

00:10:02.520 --> 00:10:03.960
I had a long,

00:10:04.600 --> 00:10:05.600
long dream.

00:10:08.240 --> 00:10:09.440
I'll tell you about it
when I have the chance.

00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:19.159
Is this all right?
Is your anger gone now?

00:10:19.160 --> 00:10:20.160
You suck.

00:10:23.520 --> 00:10:24.520
Why are you two here too?

00:10:32.640 --> 00:10:33.640
Are you here
to watch the sunrise too?

00:10:35.440 --> 00:10:36.440
You won't understand.

00:10:40.320 --> 00:10:42.120
I haven't seen
tomorrow's sun for a long time.

00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:50.320
I think we first met
on this rooftop.

00:10:51.200 --> 00:10:52.200
If you...

00:10:53.240 --> 00:10:54.600
didn't come back then,

00:10:55.240 --> 00:10:56.320
we wouldn't be together.

00:10:57.240 --> 00:10:58.840
Zhao insisted back then...

00:10:59.640 --> 00:11:01.039
that the places the terminator
passes through...

00:11:01.040 --> 00:11:02.040
would achieve a delicate balance...

00:11:02.041 --> 00:11:03.400
with the sun's gravity,

00:11:04.600 --> 00:11:06.239
and the gateway
to a parallel universe...

00:11:06.240 --> 00:11:07.240
of a higher dimension would open.

00:11:08.400 --> 00:11:09.960
I wouldn't believe him,
so he made a bet with me.

00:11:11.080 --> 00:11:12.080
In the end, he didn't come,

00:11:12.120 --> 00:11:13.120
but you came.

00:11:14.240 --> 00:11:16.520
I just wanted to take a photo
of the sunrise that day.

00:11:17.920 --> 00:11:19.200
How did this happen by chance?

00:11:22.840 --> 00:11:23.840
Let's end this...

00:11:24.400 --> 00:11:25.440
where it started.

00:11:27.080 --> 00:11:28.080
Let's put closure to this.

00:11:36.640 --> 00:11:37.720
It's 5:58am.

00:11:43.960 --> 00:11:44.960
See you.

00:11:48.080 --> 00:11:49.120
It'd be better
if we don't see each other again.
