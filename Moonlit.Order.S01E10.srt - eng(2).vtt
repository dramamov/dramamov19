00:01:41.212 --> 00:01:41.932
He was nice.

00:01:42.973 --> 00:01:44.333
But are you sure His Majesty...

00:01:48.333 --> 00:01:49.652
Meant to cultivate you?

00:01:50.292 --> 00:01:51.693
If he truly cared about you,

00:01:52.292 --> 00:01:53.572
would he have let you

00:01:53.772 --> 00:01:54.572
become ruthless

00:01:55.048 --> 00:01:56.104
and devoid of emotion?

00:01:58.376 --> 00:01:59.733
Without His Majesty,

00:02:00.616 --> 00:02:01.813
I would have died.

00:02:13.733 --> 00:02:14.212
Fine.

00:02:15.464 --> 00:02:16.072
That's it.

00:02:16.648 --> 00:02:17.293
I'll stop.

00:02:18.972 --> 00:02:20.293
If he hadn't saved you,

00:02:20.333 --> 00:02:21.453
I wouldn't have met you.

00:02:21.733 --> 00:02:23.212
I'm grateful. Happy now?

00:02:24.453 --> 00:02:26.092
But you're barely over twenty

00:02:26.532 --> 00:02:28.133
and your beloved has died.

00:02:28.772 --> 00:02:29.733
Heaven has been

00:02:29.932 --> 00:02:30.893
too cruel to you.

00:02:36.492 --> 00:02:37.613
Why the long face?

00:02:39.772 --> 00:02:41.133
I'll cherish you like you

00:02:41.453 --> 00:02:42.053
cherished him.

00:02:45.532 --> 00:02:46.293
I'll be your family

00:02:46.733 --> 00:02:47.772
and keep you company.

00:02:52.573 --> 00:02:53.893
I am your family already.

00:03:00.092 --> 00:03:01.320
I'm your stepmother.

00:03:02.333 --> 00:03:03.932
Neither you nor my father

00:03:04.453 --> 00:03:05.613
meant to get married.

00:03:06.092 --> 00:03:07.453
I'll arrange your divorce.

00:03:08.053 --> 00:03:09.733
Since when do you have a say?

00:03:10.212 --> 00:03:11.652
I've always had a say.

00:03:13.733 --> 00:03:14.293
From now on,

00:03:15.453 --> 00:03:16.733
I won't call you stepmother.

00:03:17.293 --> 00:03:18.173
What do you say?

00:03:18.772 --> 00:03:19.613
May I ask your name?

00:03:22.893 --> 00:03:23.532
Feng...

00:03:23.853 --> 00:03:24.812
F-Feng Zuo...

00:03:24.932 --> 00:03:25.652
Wang Feng.

00:03:26.173 --> 00:03:27.613
What a simple and lovely name.

00:03:29.053 --> 00:03:31.053
Wang Feng. Wang Feng.

00:03:31.053 --> 00:03:31.692
Are you done?

00:03:32.212 --> 00:03:33.333
Let's go back.

00:03:33.853 --> 00:03:34.733
I have things to do.

00:03:36.092 --> 00:03:36.932
What's more urgent

00:03:37.092 --> 00:03:38.573
than getting medical treatment?

00:03:39.453 --> 00:03:41.293
I must capture Gu Qianfu and find out

00:03:41.733 --> 00:03:43.293
who commissioned him and whether

00:03:43.733 --> 00:03:44.492
it's related

00:03:45.092 --> 00:03:46.652
to the former Crown Prince.

00:03:48.573 --> 00:03:49.932
We don't have to do it in person.

00:04:01.736 --> 00:04:02.692
Still pooping?

00:04:03.013 --> 00:04:04.424
I didn't finish last time.

00:04:04.812 --> 00:04:05.333
Still?

00:04:05.733 --> 00:04:06.632
None of your business.

00:04:07.613 --> 00:04:08.333
What do you want?

00:04:14.092 --> 00:04:14.772
My bounty.

00:04:15.573 --> 00:04:17.332
You dare ask for payment?

00:04:17.533 --> 00:04:18.012
Why?

00:04:18.173 --> 00:04:19.252
Did you kill the target?

00:04:19.252 --> 00:04:19.733
Yeah.

00:04:19.812 --> 00:04:20.413
How?

00:04:20.452 --> 00:04:23.144
I saw Xue Hexu fall from the cliff.

00:04:23.413 --> 00:04:25.053
He's definitely dead.

00:04:25.053 --> 00:04:26.452
Definitely dead?

00:04:26.452 --> 00:04:29.132
Xue Hexu wailed on Xue Street

00:04:29.252 --> 00:04:30.293
that his stepmother

00:04:30.413 --> 00:04:31.812
died protecting him.

00:04:32.213 --> 00:04:32.613
What?

00:04:50.812 --> 00:04:52.213
Feels good.

00:04:52.622 --> 00:04:54.701
(Xue Mansion)

00:04:57.372 --> 00:04:57.973
Nobody is here.

00:04:58.413 --> 00:04:59.332
Go patch up.

00:04:59.892 --> 00:05:00.892
Will it work?

00:05:13.293 --> 00:05:14.173
My goodness.

00:05:15.132 --> 00:05:17.932
Hexu and Stepmother finally decided

00:05:17.973 --> 00:05:20.533
to defy feudal traditions?

00:05:22.572 --> 00:05:23.173
Fine.

00:05:23.812 --> 00:05:26.012
Today, I will

00:05:26.173 --> 00:05:28.413
safeguard true love.

00:05:33.132 --> 00:05:33.613
You.

00:05:34.093 --> 00:05:34.533
Come here.

00:05:36.812 --> 00:05:37.252
Miss.

00:05:37.293 --> 00:05:37.973
Pass on my word.

00:05:38.053 --> 00:05:39.432
This area's restricted today.

00:05:39.653 --> 00:05:41.213
I'm admiring the moon here.

00:05:41.413 --> 00:05:42.892
Don't disturb me.

00:05:43.533 --> 00:05:44.653
Understood. I'm on it.

00:06:00.372 --> 00:06:02.293
(You were whispering sweet nothings)

00:06:02.372 --> 00:06:04.492
(and canoodling with that evil woman.)

00:06:05.692 --> 00:06:07.132
(She just passed away.)

00:06:07.692 --> 00:06:09.932
(And you're sleeping soundly
like nothing happened.)

00:06:10.653 --> 00:06:12.132
(Heartless brat.)

00:06:13.053 --> 00:06:14.492
(You deserve to die.)

00:06:23.093 --> 00:06:24.093
Perfect timing.

00:06:27.413 --> 00:06:28.132
You're alive?

00:06:39.452 --> 00:06:42.173
You adulterous scums.

00:06:42.760 --> 00:06:44.853
Even that fall didn't kill you?

00:06:45.012 --> 00:06:45.853
This time,

00:06:46.533 --> 00:06:48.653
I must uphold justice.

00:06:55.173 --> 00:06:55.613
Wait.

00:06:57.653 --> 00:06:58.372
What?

00:06:58.613 --> 00:06:59.372
What?

00:06:59.812 --> 00:07:00.252
I was...

00:07:01.093 --> 00:07:01.572
I...

00:07:17.053 --> 00:07:17.653
Stop it.

00:07:18.452 --> 00:07:19.208
Grand Tutor Zhou

00:07:20.053 --> 00:07:20.892
wants me dead. Why?

00:07:21.372 --> 00:07:22.812
If I have offended him,

00:07:22.932 --> 00:07:24.213
I'll apologize to him.

00:07:24.973 --> 00:07:25.533
Mr. Gu.

00:07:26.012 --> 00:07:26.773
Spare me.

00:07:27.932 --> 00:07:29.853
You dare disrespect Grand Tutor Zhou?

00:07:30.173 --> 00:07:31.332
Countless people

00:07:31.533 --> 00:07:32.613
want you dead.

00:07:33.093 --> 00:07:34.892
Grand Tutor wouldn't even
spare you a glance.

00:07:35.452 --> 00:07:35.973
I received

00:07:36.173 --> 00:07:37.053
a mission.

00:07:37.213 --> 00:07:39.173
They said you're utterly wicked

00:07:39.733 --> 00:07:41.293
and wanted you dead.

00:07:43.053 --> 00:07:43.653
How...

00:07:44.053 --> 00:07:45.053
How much did they offer

00:07:45.492 --> 00:07:46.733
to make you hunt me?

00:07:56.653 --> 00:07:57.372
Twenty thousand?

00:07:57.572 --> 00:07:58.452
No way.

00:07:58.733 --> 00:07:59.733
It must be 200,000.

00:08:02.132 --> 00:08:02.773
Two liang.

00:08:11.812 --> 00:08:12.413
What's that?

00:08:13.012 --> 00:08:13.733
Here's ten liang.

00:08:14.293 --> 00:08:15.012
Spare me.

00:08:16.492 --> 00:08:17.932
Take me to your employer.

00:08:18.332 --> 00:08:19.012
And it's yours.

00:08:19.293 --> 00:08:19.812
Deal.

00:08:24.012 --> 00:08:25.132
A real man knows

00:08:25.252 --> 00:08:26.053
when to yield.

00:08:30.012 --> 00:08:31.132
(He's so desperate?)

00:08:39.173 --> 00:08:39.773
What's wrong?

00:08:40.133 --> 00:08:41.773
Who issued Gu Qianfu the murder order?

00:08:42.612 --> 00:08:44.612
I gave Gu Qianfu the order.

00:08:45.092 --> 00:08:46.612
My superior wanted him dead.

00:08:46.852 --> 00:08:48.493
Take me to your superior.

00:08:48.852 --> 00:08:49.972
Let me finish my business.

00:08:50.173 --> 00:08:51.413
And I'll take you to Ms. Li

00:08:51.812 --> 00:08:52.812
from the village.

00:08:56.013 --> 00:08:57.413
I'm Ms. Li. What's wrong?

00:08:57.653 --> 00:08:59.053
You wanted Xue Hexu dead?

00:08:59.373 --> 00:09:00.212
Xue Hexu?

00:09:01.533 --> 00:09:02.293
No idea.

00:09:03.133 --> 00:09:03.852
Good heavens.

00:09:04.133 --> 00:09:06.413
I just do laundry and cooking.

00:09:06.493 --> 00:09:07.572
How could I kill anyone?

00:09:08.452 --> 00:09:11.413
But distributing missions
earns commissions.

00:09:12.653 --> 00:09:13.612
My contact is Mr. Wang

00:09:13.732 --> 00:09:14.932
from the next village.

00:09:15.533 --> 00:09:17.533
I don't know who wants Xue Hexu dead.

00:09:18.773 --> 00:09:20.373
I just received the mission

00:09:20.732 --> 00:09:22.972
from the Broadsword Sect disciple

00:09:23.092 --> 00:09:24.413
Liu Xiaodan.

00:09:26.092 --> 00:09:27.493
We don't have fixed wages

00:09:28.053 --> 00:09:29.493
and earn commissions.

00:09:30.413 --> 00:09:30.972
This month,

00:09:31.332 --> 00:09:33.212
with no leads
on the former Crown Prince,

00:09:33.852 --> 00:09:34.773
I'm penniless.

00:09:35.773 --> 00:09:37.212
So I had to take odd jobs.

00:09:39.852 --> 00:09:40.413
In short,

00:09:40.932 --> 00:09:42.133
I've tracked down

00:09:42.332 --> 00:09:43.293
the mission originator.

00:09:45.612 --> 00:09:47.373
Broadsword Sect's Liu Xiaodan.

00:09:47.893 --> 00:09:48.533
Ask him

00:09:48.773 --> 00:09:49.612
whatever you want.

00:09:50.504 --> 00:09:52.424
(Tomb of Liu Xiaodan,
Disciple of Broadsword Sect)

00:09:56.852 --> 00:09:58.893
Gu Qianfu, how dare you tease me?

00:09:59.133 --> 00:10:00.264
How would I know that

00:10:00.264 --> 00:10:00.932
Liu Xiaodan

00:10:00.932 --> 00:10:02.092
would die in a mission?

00:10:02.612 --> 00:10:03.612
I did my best.

00:10:06.092 --> 00:10:07.212
How do we question

00:10:07.332 --> 00:10:07.852
a dead guy?

00:10:14.332 --> 00:10:15.852
Need a psychic?

00:10:18.732 --> 00:10:19.773
Business is tough.

00:10:20.013 --> 00:10:21.332
More skills never hurt.

00:10:25.932 --> 00:10:28.092
We still don't know who wants me dead.

00:10:28.452 --> 00:10:29.932
But at least, we paid Gu Qianfu

00:10:29.972 --> 00:10:30.732
to spare my life.

00:10:31.212 --> 00:10:32.133
You can be at ease.

00:10:32.612 --> 00:10:33.092
You fool.

00:10:33.732 --> 00:10:34.493
At this point,

00:10:34.692 --> 00:10:35.932
we need another approach.

00:10:38.212 --> 00:10:39.173
You're terrified

00:10:39.493 --> 00:10:39.972
I'd die?

00:10:43.452 --> 00:10:45.133
Pressing matters await. Come.

00:10:55.612 --> 00:10:56.092
(He...)

00:10:58.373 --> 00:10:59.852
He is the former Crown Prince?

00:11:02.173 --> 00:11:03.773
Days ago, I found his portrait.

00:11:04.493 --> 00:11:05.732
Let's find him and hand him

00:11:06.332 --> 00:11:06.893
over.

00:11:08.612 --> 00:11:09.092
(No way.)

00:11:09.812 --> 00:11:10.572
(It can't be him.)

00:11:11.253 --> 00:11:12.212
(How could it be him?)

00:11:15.332 --> 00:11:16.253
You know this man?

00:11:17.253 --> 00:11:17.852
No.

00:11:23.893 --> 00:11:24.852
No, I don't.

00:11:25.852 --> 00:11:26.893
(Xue Hexu)

00:11:27.533 --> 00:11:29.092
(is hiding something from me.)

00:11:41.653 --> 00:11:42.653
It's him?

00:11:43.293 --> 00:11:44.932
He's the former Crown Prince!

00:11:50.888 --> 00:11:51.812
(Two years ago)

00:11:51.812 --> 00:11:52.253
Father.

00:11:53.692 --> 00:11:54.253
Look.

00:11:54.452 --> 00:11:55.812
There's something odd.

00:11:56.972 --> 00:11:57.932
Something is sent south

00:11:58.253 --> 00:11:59.812
in the first month every year.

00:12:00.092 --> 00:12:01.092
Sometimes money,

00:12:01.173 --> 00:12:02.133
sometimes textiles,

00:12:02.253 --> 00:12:03.133
sometimes rice.

00:12:03.612 --> 00:12:05.893
At market prices, it's always 500 taels,

00:12:06.332 --> 00:12:07.852
which is enough to sustain

00:12:08.493 --> 00:12:09.732
any commoner for 20 years.

00:12:10.692 --> 00:12:11.293
Hexu.

00:12:12.572 --> 00:12:13.812
I'm providing

00:12:13.932 --> 00:12:17.133
for my former subordinates
who fought for our nation.

00:12:18.293 --> 00:12:19.173
Forget about it.

00:12:20.452 --> 00:12:22.653
We can't spare this expenditure.

00:12:23.932 --> 00:12:24.373
Alright.

00:12:29.493 --> 00:12:31.612
You spend money and effort

00:12:32.092 --> 00:12:33.852
on some illegitimate child,

00:12:34.212 --> 00:12:36.373
while neglecting your own children.

00:12:36.893 --> 00:12:38.373
Have you lost your mind?

00:12:38.692 --> 00:12:39.212
Mother.

00:12:39.656 --> 00:12:41.013
Back then, we had no choice

00:12:41.612 --> 00:12:43.293
but to make such a decision.

00:12:43.732 --> 00:12:46.612
After all these years,
many things can't be undone.

00:12:47.253 --> 00:12:49.293
Now we must see this through to the end.

00:12:49.893 --> 00:12:50.332
You...

00:12:56.104 --> 00:12:57.522
(Xue Mansion)

00:13:14.408 --> 00:13:18.496
(Nanwu Town)

00:13:20.533 --> 00:13:21.452
Try this, sir.

00:13:21.932 --> 00:13:22.533
Try it.

00:13:22.692 --> 00:13:24.013
(Nanwu Dock)
Fresh cucumbers, crisp and juicy.

00:13:24.173 --> 00:13:24.852
Try some.

00:13:25.053 --> 00:13:26.253
Try some, sir.

00:13:26.452 --> 00:13:27.612
Crisp and fresh. Try one.

00:13:28.293 --> 00:13:30.332
He wanders around without purpose.

00:13:30.493 --> 00:13:32.533
We can't do anything about him.

00:13:35.133 --> 00:13:35.692
Master,

00:13:35.893 --> 00:13:37.533
please help my useless son.

00:13:38.092 --> 00:13:38.932
Please get up.

00:13:40.456 --> 00:13:45.493
(Xue Youshou, Xue Mansion)

00:13:45.493 --> 00:13:47.173
He's a good child.

00:13:47.653 --> 00:13:49.293
But an evil spirit possessed him

00:13:49.653 --> 00:13:50.692
and corrupted his soul.

00:13:51.133 --> 00:13:52.452
Without immediate intervention,

00:13:53.173 --> 00:13:54.653
disaster will surely follow.

00:13:56.493 --> 00:13:58.293
Your entire clan could be doomed.

00:13:58.893 --> 00:13:59.452
Master,

00:14:00.212 --> 00:14:00.612
so...

00:14:01.053 --> 00:14:03.368
How can we exorcise the evil spirit?

00:14:03.893 --> 00:14:05.773
How to avert this calamity?

00:14:06.092 --> 00:14:07.653
My master cultivated for a millennium

00:14:08.053 --> 00:14:10.612
to build this celestial tower

00:14:10.932 --> 00:14:12.173
with boundless magic.

00:14:13.133 --> 00:14:14.133
Celestial tower?

00:14:14.932 --> 00:14:15.572
Where is it?

00:14:16.293 --> 00:14:17.692
Far as the horizon,

00:14:19.653 --> 00:14:20.812
near as your sight.

00:14:23.413 --> 00:14:24.493
A millennium of cultivation

00:14:24.972 --> 00:14:27.013
for such a small tower?

00:14:30.013 --> 00:14:32.572
Mountains needn't be tall.
With immortals, they become holy.

00:14:33.332 --> 00:14:34.413
Within this tower,

00:14:34.773 --> 00:14:38.092
my master enshrines
the Ultra Supreme Elder Lord.

00:14:39.332 --> 00:14:40.253
Master,

00:14:40.253 --> 00:14:43.013
bury 100 liang of gold under this tree.

00:14:43.732 --> 00:14:45.013
I'll perform rituals daily

00:14:45.293 --> 00:14:46.893
for 49 days.

00:14:47.092 --> 00:14:48.452
Golden pills will form.

00:14:48.572 --> 00:14:49.692
All gold will be returned.

00:14:49.692 --> 00:14:51.493
I'll keep none.

00:14:51.493 --> 00:14:53.533
The pills will be yours.

00:14:54.692 --> 00:14:56.852
One pill per day

00:14:57.092 --> 00:14:57.773
for a month

00:14:58.812 --> 00:15:00.013
should cure your son.

00:15:01.173 --> 00:15:02.253
You charge nothing.

00:15:02.413 --> 00:15:03.493
What a living Buddha.

00:15:03.653 --> 00:15:04.572
I'll bury the gold now.

00:15:04.692 --> 00:15:05.452
Hurry up.

00:15:05.692 --> 00:15:06.152
Hurry.

00:15:18.092 --> 00:15:19.013
My ritual connects

00:15:19.612 --> 00:15:20.773
Heaven and Earth.

00:15:21.253 --> 00:15:22.612
No observers are allowed.

00:15:23.013 --> 00:15:23.493
Master,

00:15:24.013 --> 00:15:25.053
please leave now.

00:15:26.533 --> 00:15:27.572
Thank you, Master.

00:15:45.352 --> 00:15:46.932
This Daoist priest didn't show

00:15:47.092 --> 00:15:48.253
any signs of divine power.

00:15:48.852 --> 00:15:50.092
Exactly.

00:15:50.332 --> 00:15:52.332
Master resorted to this method

00:15:52.533 --> 00:15:53.812
out of desperation.

00:15:55.133 --> 00:15:57.013
He's full of mumbo jumbo.

00:15:57.452 --> 00:15:59.092
Let's keep watch closely.

00:16:01.413 --> 00:16:02.373
By the cosmic decree!

00:16:18.732 --> 00:16:19.812
Thank you, Master.

00:16:35.852 --> 00:16:36.893
Take care, sir.

00:16:37.013 --> 00:16:37.612
Alright.

00:16:40.053 --> 00:16:40.812
Mr. Xue.

00:16:40.972 --> 00:16:42.413
Please come in.

00:16:48.488 --> 00:16:52.084
(Nanwu Beauties)

00:16:53.653 --> 00:16:54.173
Lan.

00:16:55.293 --> 00:16:55.932
Let's begin.

00:16:58.773 --> 00:17:00.053
You can enjoy music anywhere

00:17:00.533 --> 00:17:01.692
with little money.

00:17:02.452 --> 00:17:03.732
You don't have to come

00:17:03.893 --> 00:17:05.132
and waste a fortune.

00:17:06.453 --> 00:17:07.533
The music you play

00:17:07.973 --> 00:17:09.172
is unparalleled.

00:17:10.293 --> 00:17:12.693
Even the magistrate
begged for three months

00:17:13.172 --> 00:17:14.372
and still couldn't meet you.

00:17:15.493 --> 00:17:16.852
Naturally,

00:17:18.172 --> 00:17:19.652
you outrank the magistrate.

00:17:26.453 --> 00:17:28.933
♪Alone in my sorrow♪

00:17:28.933 --> 00:17:32.904
♪How have I sinned♪

00:17:35.852 --> 00:17:38.693
♪For what crime am I blamed♪

00:17:38.693 --> 00:17:42.824
♪My heart grieves deeply♪

00:17:46.493 --> 00:17:49.652
♪Not belonging to the exterior♪

00:17:49.652 --> 00:17:53.253
♪Not departing from the interior♪

00:17:55.412 --> 00:17:57.933
♪Heaven brought me forth♪

00:17:57.933 --> 00:18:03.013
♪Where is my destined time♪

00:18:11.372 --> 00:18:12.733
Lan is mine today.

00:18:13.293 --> 00:18:13.773
Get lost.

00:18:30.412 --> 00:18:31.092
Who are you?

00:18:32.533 --> 00:18:33.288
My surname is Xue.

00:18:34.533 --> 00:18:35.293
Lord Dingyuan

00:18:36.053 --> 00:18:36.773
is my father.

00:19:22.132 --> 00:19:22.733
Xue Youshou.

00:19:27.332 --> 00:19:28.172
Pay your rent.

00:19:28.493 --> 00:19:30.412
Two liang. It's been half a year.

00:19:30.892 --> 00:19:32.213
Enough with your tricks.

00:19:32.533 --> 00:19:34.213
Pay today or get out.

00:19:39.652 --> 00:19:40.293
There you go.

00:19:41.572 --> 00:19:42.572
Your impressive demeanor

00:19:42.652 --> 00:19:43.812
really brings honor

00:19:44.132 --> 00:19:45.852
to our humble establishment.

00:19:46.733 --> 00:19:47.213
Come on.

00:19:47.693 --> 00:19:48.213
Hurry.

00:19:48.652 --> 00:19:49.132
Please sit.

00:19:49.412 --> 00:19:49.852
Here.

00:19:51.812 --> 00:19:53.892
Get him some new bedding

00:19:54.053 --> 00:19:54.693
and a tea set.

00:19:54.773 --> 00:19:55.733
Keep the rest.

00:19:56.652 --> 00:19:57.213
Alright.

00:19:57.733 --> 00:20:00.013
I always knew Xue Youshou was blessed.

00:20:00.533 --> 00:20:01.693
I'll work on it now.

00:20:06.053 --> 00:20:07.412
You had 100 liang of gold,

00:20:07.852 --> 00:20:09.572
but can't pay two liang of silver?

00:20:13.013 --> 00:20:13.812
You followed me?

00:20:16.092 --> 00:20:17.973
Let me pay the rent for you.

00:20:19.812 --> 00:20:21.053
So unnecessary.

00:20:22.533 --> 00:20:25.213
Lord Dingyuan Xue Fugui

00:20:26.453 --> 00:20:27.132
is your father?

00:20:29.092 --> 00:20:30.412
Did he tell you that?

00:20:31.652 --> 00:20:32.293
No, he didn't.

00:20:32.933 --> 00:20:33.612
I found out.

00:20:35.293 --> 00:20:35.773
You

00:20:36.572 --> 00:20:37.693
were born to his concubine?

00:20:40.132 --> 00:20:41.053
Concubine?

00:20:44.412 --> 00:20:45.172
Concubine.

00:20:49.693 --> 00:20:51.172
I don't deserve recognition.

00:20:56.013 --> 00:20:57.733
Your mother is the legitimate wife?

00:21:01.572 --> 00:21:02.412
I'm Xue Hexu.

00:21:02.773 --> 00:21:03.453
Second in line.

00:21:04.053 --> 00:21:05.768
I was born with
my twin sister Xue Nuannuan

00:21:06.293 --> 00:21:07.688
on the fifth of the fifth month.

00:21:08.092 --> 00:21:09.933
You seem about my age.

00:21:10.372 --> 00:21:10.984
Your birthday?

00:21:13.013 --> 00:21:14.216
The fifth of the fifth month?

00:21:16.892 --> 00:21:17.332
We were

00:21:18.293 --> 00:21:19.372
born on the same day?

00:21:23.812 --> 00:21:24.812
That is

00:21:27.812 --> 00:21:28.852
my birthday.

00:21:30.372 --> 00:21:31.533
The same day.

00:21:32.612 --> 00:21:34.253
He made them give birth

00:21:34.652 --> 00:21:36.253
on the same day. What an animal.

00:21:36.852 --> 00:21:38.053
Why are you here?

00:21:38.773 --> 00:21:40.973
Not to arrest me, I hope?

00:21:42.933 --> 00:21:43.612
No harm intended.

00:21:44.733 --> 00:21:45.372
Hasn't Father

00:21:47.092 --> 00:21:49.053
ever come looking for you?

00:21:49.453 --> 00:21:50.013
No.

00:21:52.172 --> 00:21:53.412
How cold-hearted.

00:21:55.132 --> 00:21:56.493
He gives you 500 liang yearly,

00:21:56.693 --> 00:21:58.973
yet you live like this?

00:22:00.253 --> 00:22:01.773
I was exiled at seven.

00:22:02.572 --> 00:22:03.372
I was too young

00:22:03.612 --> 00:22:04.652
to manage finances.

00:22:06.132 --> 00:22:07.933
He sent money to a former subordinate.

00:22:08.733 --> 00:22:09.213
But

00:22:10.773 --> 00:22:12.132
he kept it all.

00:22:13.773 --> 00:22:15.372
I couldn't even keep day-old bread,

00:22:15.733 --> 00:22:17.572
let alone have tasty pickles.

00:22:18.493 --> 00:22:19.053
I was eight

00:22:19.892 --> 00:22:21.332
when I started roaming the streets.

00:22:23.652 --> 00:22:24.572
Meanwhile,

00:22:24.812 --> 00:22:27.253
they've been leading a wealthy

00:22:27.973 --> 00:22:28.892
and luxurious life.

00:22:30.253 --> 00:22:31.172
For real?

00:22:34.213 --> 00:22:35.240
I'll get your money back.

00:22:36.933 --> 00:22:37.372
No need.

00:22:39.332 --> 00:22:40.053
I don't want to

00:22:40.332 --> 00:22:41.693
burden your Xue family.

00:22:42.572 --> 00:22:43.693
Perhaps this is

00:22:44.773 --> 00:22:46.132
heaven's punishment for me.

00:22:48.213 --> 00:22:49.092
Why

00:22:49.493 --> 00:22:50.533
are you here exactly?

00:22:51.572 --> 00:22:52.773
To check on you.

00:23:00.812 --> 00:23:01.852
That jade pendant

00:23:02.453 --> 00:23:03.053
looks nice.

00:23:04.053 --> 00:23:05.253
It says "Qinghe" on it.

00:23:05.812 --> 00:23:07.412
There must be another piece

00:23:07.733 --> 00:23:08.493
marked "Zhengming"?

00:23:13.092 --> 00:23:13.933
This is

00:23:14.892 --> 00:23:16.293
the only thing my mother left me.

00:23:18.773 --> 00:23:20.612
It should be treasured.

00:23:21.412 --> 00:23:23.053
Yet I shattered it by mistake.

00:23:24.572 --> 00:23:25.453
But it does have

00:23:25.973 --> 00:23:27.053
the "Zhengming" on it.

00:23:36.053 --> 00:23:36.652
What a pity.

00:23:37.013 --> 00:23:37.933
It's broken.

00:23:39.172 --> 00:23:40.013
But it's pretty.

00:23:44.852 --> 00:23:46.092
