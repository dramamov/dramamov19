Madam. Don't, Madam.

00:01:46.430 --> 00:01:47.710
Don't do this, Madam.

00:01:48.120 --> 00:01:48.960
Madam!

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:52.790
Madam.

00:01:52.790 --> 00:01:53.630
- Chun.
- Chun.

00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:55.240
- Chun.
- Chun.

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:56.680
- Chun.
- Chun.

00:01:56.680 --> 00:01:57.680
Chun, are you all right?

00:01:57.950 --> 00:01:58.790
- No.
- Chun.

00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:00.200
Let me go.

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:01.040
Chun.

00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:02.640
How could you

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:03.920
do something so foolish?

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:06.840
On my wedding day, I sprained my ankle.

00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:08.190
He noticed that

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:09.630
and carried me all the way back.

00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:12.120
He even wiped my foot
with medicinal liquor.

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:14.800
If I hadn't experienced love,

00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:16.870
I'd surrender to fate.

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:17.750
But I once had

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:18.710
such a wonderful man.

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:21.120
I can't spend the rest of my life alone.

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:22.520
Let me go.

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:23.910
Chun. Chun.

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:25.590
Chun!

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:27.800
If your death could restart everything,

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:29.030
we would not stop you.

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:30.960
But what you're doing

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:33.400
will only bring us trouble.

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:34.590
It won't help at all.

00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:37.470
No matter who dies,

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:40.680
life must move on.

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:42.270
That's not true.

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:43.430
That's not.

00:02:43.630 --> 00:02:44.590
Let me go.

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:45.470
Dying is easy.

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:48.120
But what about Lingchun?

00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:52.360
Lingchun.

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:54.990
Lingchun, my son.

00:02:55.750 --> 00:02:57.190
You and Shu loved each other.

00:02:57.680 --> 00:02:59.630
Lingchun has lived happily
since he was born.

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:03.120
Suddenly, he lost his father.

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:05.520
How could you let him
lose his mother too?

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:07.680
Chun.

00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:11.150
All men in our family

00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:13.000
are unyielding.

00:03:13.630 --> 00:03:14.800
Your husband not only defended

00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:16.310
our nation and its people.

00:03:17.240 --> 00:03:20.360
He also wanted you to be carefree.

00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:23.640
Chun,

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:25.800
you are his wife

00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:27.560
and madam of the second branch.

00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:30.870
My eldest son never married.

00:03:32.240 --> 00:03:33.360
So, you're just like

00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:35.080
my eldest daughter-in-law.

00:03:35.960 --> 00:03:37.680
You've been taking care of this family

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:39.310
and haven't put a foot wrong.

00:03:40.590 --> 00:03:42.160
(Wei)
Now,

00:03:42.190 --> 00:03:44.120
I'm entrusting you
with the Commanding Jade Seal

00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:45.680
of this family.

00:03:46.960 --> 00:03:48.310
Hope you will not

00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:50.080
(Wei)
let me down.

00:03:51.590 --> 00:03:52.430
Chun.

00:03:54.680 --> 00:03:56.400
- Madam.
- Chun.

00:04:06.800 --> 00:04:07.640
Mother,

00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:10.750
I won't do such a foolish thing again.

00:04:11.750 --> 00:04:12.630
I promise you.

00:04:13.590 --> 00:04:14.590
Unless I'm dead,

00:04:15.800 --> 00:04:17.390
I will always protect this family.

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:22.920
Don't cry, Chun.

00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:24.120
- Mother.
- Don't.

00:04:30.430 --> 00:04:31.430
Mother.

00:04:31.750 --> 00:04:32.590
Chun.

00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:36.200
(Wei Yun,)

00:04:37.510 --> 00:04:38.800
(you didn't protect your family.)

00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:41.240
(You're in no position to comfort them.)

00:05:19.750 --> 00:05:20.590
Chu Yu.

00:05:21.750 --> 00:05:22.590
What on earth

00:05:23.270 --> 00:05:24.110
do you want from us?

00:05:30.310 --> 00:05:31.150
What do you mean?

00:05:31.390 --> 00:05:32.680
My big brother is dead.

00:05:33.560 --> 00:05:35.040
But you're determined to be his widow.

00:05:35.430 --> 00:05:37.000
What on earth

00:05:37.920 --> 00:05:39.160
are you up to?

00:05:40.800 --> 00:05:42.510
What if I simply like Wei Jun?

00:05:42.720 --> 00:05:43.720
Others may

00:05:43.720 --> 00:05:44.630
buy that lie.

00:05:44.630 --> 00:05:45.560
But you won't fool me.

00:05:46.240 --> 00:05:48.150
You made a scene
at the Spring Breeze House

00:05:48.560 --> 00:05:49.590
and you came here today.

00:05:49.830 --> 00:05:52.040
You've been plotting this all along.

00:05:53.560 --> 00:05:55.000
Is it for my big brother

00:05:56.750 --> 00:05:58.000
or actually for this family?

00:06:00.510 --> 00:06:01.350
Wei Yun,

00:06:01.600 --> 00:06:03.270
instead of suspecting my purpose,

00:06:03.680 --> 00:06:04.870
why don't you think

00:06:05.680 --> 00:06:07.750
about how you can get justice

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:09.630
for your lost family and dead soldiers?

00:06:16.240 --> 00:06:17.080
Yun.

00:06:29.680 --> 00:06:30.520
Back in there,

00:06:30.680 --> 00:06:32.620
you saved Chun in time.

00:06:33.190 --> 00:06:35.630
I had my reservations about you.

00:06:36.360 --> 00:06:37.240
- Now...
- Mother.

00:06:38.560 --> 00:06:39.680
Don't let her fool you.

00:06:42.830 --> 00:06:44.000
Stop being so rude to her.

00:06:58.800 --> 00:06:59.760
I'm going to the mourning hall.

00:07:20.270 --> 00:07:21.120
Yun is

00:07:21.950 --> 00:07:23.040
in great distress.

00:07:24.240 --> 00:07:25.680
If he comes off as offensive,

00:07:26.160 --> 00:07:27.120
please don't mind.

00:07:28.070 --> 00:07:28.910
I won't.

00:07:30.240 --> 00:07:32.000
It's not easy for you to trust me.

00:07:32.510 --> 00:07:33.350
And anyway,

00:07:34.630 --> 00:07:35.680
Wei Yun had a narrow escape

00:07:35.680 --> 00:07:36.680
from the battlefield.

00:07:42.750 --> 00:07:44.920
I have something to say as well.

00:07:46.240 --> 00:07:48.000
You're a different daughter-in-law.

00:07:48.750 --> 00:07:49.720
My eldest son

00:07:50.070 --> 00:07:51.430
didn't marry you

00:07:51.680 --> 00:07:52.800
with a formal wedding.

00:07:53.680 --> 00:07:54.750
After the funeral,

00:07:54.750 --> 00:07:55.720
you can think it through.

00:07:56.430 --> 00:07:58.000
You're free to go home anytime.

00:07:59.080 --> 00:08:00.950
Do not waste

00:08:01.100 --> 00:08:02.360
your youth here.

00:08:07.430 --> 00:08:08.270
All right.

00:08:09.360 --> 00:08:10.360
I'll think it through

00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:11.950
and let you know.

00:08:29.240 --> 00:08:30.600
Before, Brother and I

00:08:30.600 --> 00:08:31.600
tried really hard,

00:08:31.950 --> 00:08:33.480
only to find out about a mountain.

00:08:34.150 --> 00:08:35.630
You think you can get more information

00:08:35.960 --> 00:08:37.000
by simply rummaging around?

00:08:37.960 --> 00:08:39.480
I was just trying to see

00:08:39.480 --> 00:08:40.720
what I could do to help.

00:08:41.910 --> 00:08:43.360
You must not touch

00:08:43.510 --> 00:08:44.350
Mr. Wei Jun's stuff.

00:08:55.960 --> 00:08:56.840
Since Father died,

00:08:58.030 --> 00:08:59.120
I've locked up

00:08:59.120 --> 00:08:59.960
his study.

00:09:01.150 --> 00:09:02.150
Everything in there

00:09:02.390 --> 00:09:03.440
is kept the way it was.

00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:05.840
Every time I see it,

00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:08.750
I feel as if he were still around me.

00:09:22.870 --> 00:09:24.670
Mr. Wei Jun was upright and honest.

00:09:25.240 --> 00:09:26.510
Pretend I'm doing the same

00:09:26.960 --> 00:09:27.870
for his own brother.

00:09:32.720 --> 00:09:33.560
What's wrong?

00:09:34.630 --> 00:09:35.470
Let me see.

00:09:38.910 --> 00:09:40.150
How did it end up like this?

00:09:40.960 --> 00:09:41.800
You leave it alone.

00:09:50.790 --> 00:09:51.630
Does it hurt?

00:09:55.390 --> 00:09:56.870
It's the first day you've been here

00:09:57.360 --> 00:09:58.480
and you're already hurt.

00:09:59.240 --> 00:10:01.030
What's going to happen in the future?

00:10:04.960 --> 00:10:05.800
My Lady,

00:10:05.960 --> 00:10:07.290
what are your plans?

00:10:08.470 --> 00:10:11.040
We'll help them through this crisis.

00:10:13.180 --> 00:10:14.900
They're in such big trouble.

00:10:15.380 --> 00:10:16.300
Maybe it's related

00:10:16.540 --> 00:10:18.340
to the leak of the octagonal crossbow.

00:10:19.540 --> 00:10:21.020
I'm at the center of the vortex

00:10:21.660 --> 00:10:23.300
and I have to be involved.

00:10:23.700 --> 00:10:25.140
Otherwise, I will be consumed by it.

00:10:26.740 --> 00:10:28.300
But I see General Wei Yun

00:10:28.540 --> 00:10:30.300
press you really hard.

00:10:31.300 --> 00:10:32.420
I'm afraid

00:10:32.660 --> 00:10:33.940
you will have a really hard time

00:10:34.180 --> 00:10:35.340
in this mansion.

00:10:38.060 --> 00:10:38.980
I'm worried that...

00:10:39.420 --> 00:10:40.260
Don't worry.

00:10:42.300 --> 00:10:43.580
Mr. Wei Jun just died in battle.

00:10:44.220 --> 00:10:45.060
I suddenly

00:10:45.060 --> 00:10:46.820
became his widow.

00:10:47.340 --> 00:10:48.260
If I were Wei Yun,

00:10:48.460 --> 00:10:49.340
I'd be suspicious too.

00:10:51.900 --> 00:10:53.700
Once I find out the truth, I will leave.

00:10:54.140 --> 00:10:55.340
I don't want to be a burden.

00:10:57.220 --> 00:10:58.220
As for Wei Yun...

00:11:00.780 --> 00:11:01.820
We'll cross that bridge

00:11:01.820 --> 00:11:02.900
when we come to it.

00:11:06.660 --> 00:11:09.300
(True Might)

00:11:13.580 --> 00:11:15.020
Kneel.

00:11:48.420 --> 00:11:50.900
Read the funeral oration

00:11:51.220 --> 00:11:53.900
to tell their stories.

00:12:08.140 --> 00:12:09.380
The 27th day of the 7th month

00:12:10.660 --> 00:12:11.660
marked the border crisis.

00:12:13.460 --> 00:12:15.300
My father, brothers, and I rushed there.

00:12:16.380 --> 00:12:18.580
We fought for seven days and nights

00:12:19.780 --> 00:12:20.860
before repelling the enemy.

00:12:22.700 --> 00:12:23.660
That night, we drank.

00:12:24.500 --> 00:12:25.620
My brothers and I

00:12:26.580 --> 00:12:28.100
got drunk on the city tower.

00:12:29.780 --> 00:12:30.660
I was too young

00:12:31.100 --> 00:12:32.180
to know the life meaning.

00:12:33.500 --> 00:12:34.660
So, I asked my brothers

00:12:35.740 --> 00:12:37.060
what they would wish for.

00:12:38.460 --> 00:12:39.300
My big brother said

00:12:40.340 --> 00:12:41.580
he wished for world peace

00:12:42.700 --> 00:12:43.980
and justice everywhere.

00:12:45.420 --> 00:12:46.420
My other brothers hailed.

00:12:50.060 --> 00:12:50.900
I asked again,

00:12:52.740 --> 00:12:53.700
"In case of world peace,

00:12:55.700 --> 00:12:56.980
what will you want to do?"

00:12:57.500 --> 00:12:58.940
(Wei's Ancestral Hall)

00:12:58.940 --> 00:13:00.380
My brother smiled and replied,

00:13:02.580 --> 00:13:04.060
"Watch the willows in spring.

00:13:05.580 --> 00:13:07.100
Enjoy the snow in winter.

00:13:08.700 --> 00:13:10.300
Drink with friends

00:13:11.140 --> 00:13:12.940
and get drunk in the restaurant.

00:13:13.940 --> 00:13:15.780
It's dangerous on the battlefield.

00:13:17.140 --> 00:13:19.060
Yet it's romantic in Huajing City.

00:13:21.500 --> 00:13:22.980
We're just ordinary guys.

00:13:25.300 --> 00:13:26.180
Whatever happens,

00:13:28.100 --> 00:13:29.420
we'll go back to loving families.

00:13:33.820 --> 00:13:34.660
That's enough."

00:13:40.860 --> 00:13:41.820
First come, first draw.

00:13:42.260 --> 00:13:43.100
- Yun.
- Yun.

00:13:43.100 --> 00:13:43.940
Don't cheat.

00:13:43.980 --> 00:13:44.860
Father.

00:13:46.180 --> 00:13:47.020
When will Yun

00:13:47.300 --> 00:13:48.820
truly grow up?

00:13:49.140 --> 00:13:50.660
Father, if he can always

00:13:50.900 --> 00:13:52.100
remain so carefree,

00:13:52.740 --> 00:13:53.580
isn't that great?

00:14:08.900 --> 00:14:15.900
(Wei)

00:14:54.700 --> 00:14:56.500
Raise the coffins!

00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:52.690
Isn't he the Minister
of the Court of Judicial Review?

00:15:52.700 --> 00:15:53.660
What's he doing here?

00:15:59.100 --> 00:16:00.460
I'm Minister Cao Yan of the Court.

00:16:00.820 --> 00:16:02.180
I was sent to get sinful Wei Yun.

00:16:09.220 --> 00:16:10.220
Mr. Cao,

00:16:12.220 --> 00:16:13.380
what crime did I commit?

00:16:15.460 --> 00:16:16.860
Your family overreached,

00:16:17.300 --> 00:16:18.700
causing the death of 70,000 soldiers

00:16:18.700 --> 00:16:19.900
in Baidi Valley.

00:16:20.180 --> 00:16:21.020
Even in death,

00:16:21.420 --> 00:16:22.540
they are held responsible.

00:16:33.140 --> 00:16:34.180
Oh, I see.

00:16:34.500 --> 00:16:35.420
All those soldiers

00:16:35.620 --> 00:16:36.860
lost their lives in vain

00:16:36.860 --> 00:16:38.060
just because of your family!

00:16:38.780 --> 00:16:39.940
Thousands of our soldiers

00:16:40.340 --> 00:16:41.460
spilled their blood

00:16:41.460 --> 00:16:42.460
and gave their lives

00:16:43.060 --> 00:16:44.140
to contribute for a century

00:16:44.140 --> 00:16:45.460
to your family's glory.

00:16:46.060 --> 00:16:47.900
How could you still be greedy?

00:16:48.580 --> 00:16:49.940
The Weis are murderers.

00:16:50.300 --> 00:16:51.460
Since Wei Yun is still alive,

00:16:51.660 --> 00:16:52.620
hold him accountable.

00:16:52.980 --> 00:16:55.100
- Hold him accountable!
- Hold him accountable!

00:16:55.820 --> 00:16:58.060
We demand justice from the court!

00:16:58.220 --> 00:17:07.940
We demand justice! We demand justice!

00:17:09.420 --> 00:17:10.540
General Wei Yun,

00:17:11.060 --> 00:17:12.100
did you hear?

00:17:13.100 --> 00:17:14.740
This is what our people want.

00:17:15.940 --> 00:17:16.940
I advise you

00:17:16.940 --> 00:17:18.500
not to resist arrest.

00:17:18.900 --> 00:17:19.860
Otherwise,

00:17:19.860 --> 00:17:21.460
I'll have to be rude.

00:17:36.460 --> 00:17:37.300
Yun.

00:17:52.300 --> 00:17:53.140
It's him.

00:17:53.140 --> 00:17:54.620
- It's him.
- It's him.

00:17:54.620 --> 00:17:56.340
What are you doing? Stop it.

00:17:56.340 --> 00:17:57.660
- Stop.
- Lan, be careful.

00:17:59.020 --> 00:17:59.860
Stop it.

00:17:59.860 --> 00:18:00.700
No.

00:18:00.900 --> 00:18:02.540
That's not true.

00:18:02.780 --> 00:18:03.620
You're to blame.

00:18:04.140 --> 00:18:05.060
Our family isn't...

00:18:07.860 --> 00:18:08.740
- Mother.
- Mother.

00:18:08.740 --> 00:18:09.580
Mother.

00:18:16.020 --> 00:18:16.860
Mr. Cao,

00:18:17.820 --> 00:18:19.380
my father and brothers aren't buried.

00:18:20.660 --> 00:18:21.620
Sorry, but right now,

00:18:21.620 --> 00:18:22.780
I can't go with you.

00:18:24.420 --> 00:18:25.300
That's not a problem.

00:18:26.220 --> 00:18:27.060
Somebody.

00:18:27.220 --> 00:18:28.700
Take these criminals' coffins

00:18:28.900 --> 00:18:30.060
back to our court too.

00:18:30.220 --> 00:18:31.060
Yes.

00:18:32.500 --> 00:18:33.340
Wait.

00:18:35.620 --> 00:18:36.460
Mr. Cao,

00:18:37.900 --> 00:18:39.660
when you enjoyed your life here,

00:18:39.900 --> 00:18:41.220
Wei's 70,000 soldiers

00:18:41.500 --> 00:18:42.900
were fighting a bloody battle

00:18:43.140 --> 00:18:43.980
to defend our nation.

00:18:46.100 --> 00:18:46.980
So, Mr. Cao,

00:18:47.420 --> 00:18:49.300
please show some respect for them.

00:18:49.900 --> 00:18:51.340
Let's not make a move

00:18:51.660 --> 00:18:52.500
until they're buried.

00:18:52.860 --> 00:18:53.740
Respect?

00:18:57.140 --> 00:18:57.980
Ms. Chu,

00:18:58.220 --> 00:18:59.300
take a close look.

00:18:59.740 --> 00:19:00.780
What wood is used

00:19:01.180 --> 00:19:02.380
for their coffins?

00:19:02.860 --> 00:19:04.740
What patterns are on them?

00:19:05.260 --> 00:19:07.580
And what paint is used?

00:19:08.500 --> 00:19:10.060
The wood, patterns,

00:19:10.660 --> 00:19:11.540
and paint are used

00:19:11.540 --> 00:19:13.380
according to the ranking

00:19:13.620 --> 00:19:15.620
of Marquis of Zhenguo and his sons.

00:19:16.180 --> 00:19:17.020
Nothing is wrong.

00:19:17.220 --> 00:19:18.060
Ridiculous.

00:19:18.740 --> 00:19:20.540
Wei Zhong and his sons are sinful.

00:19:20.660 --> 00:19:21.500
By law,

00:19:21.660 --> 00:19:23.380
they can only be buried as commoners.

00:19:24.260 --> 00:19:26.140
They don't deserve such good coffins.

00:19:26.860 --> 00:19:28.140
- Somebody.
- Here.

00:19:28.700 --> 00:19:29.620
Go to the east of town

00:19:29.620 --> 00:19:31.220
and buy some ordinary coffins.

00:19:33.740 --> 00:19:35.540
I'm being really generous.

00:19:36.180 --> 00:19:37.300
Your family has collapsed.

00:19:37.940 --> 00:19:38.780
These coffins

00:19:39.260 --> 00:19:40.180
will be my present

00:19:40.340 --> 00:19:41.420
for you.

00:19:41.940 --> 00:19:43.620
Don't bother to thank me, General.

00:19:44.540 --> 00:19:45.540
Ms. Chu,

00:19:45.860 --> 00:19:47.140
don't try to stop me anymore.

00:19:47.740 --> 00:19:48.900
Go back home

00:19:49.380 --> 00:19:52.660
and live with Wei Jun's tablet.

00:19:54.660 --> 00:19:55.500
Cao Yan,

00:19:56.420 --> 00:19:57.420
I dare you

00:19:57.420 --> 00:19:58.980
to touch their coffins!

00:19:59.660 --> 00:20:00.500
Guards.

00:20:01.140 --> 00:20:02.140
Take out the bodies

00:20:02.780 --> 00:20:04.140
of Wei Zhong and his sons.

00:20:04.140 --> 00:20:04.980
Yes.

00:20:06.180 --> 00:20:07.420
- Stop!
- What are you doing?

00:20:07.420 --> 00:20:08.260
No.

00:20:14.860 --> 00:20:15.700
Cao Yan!

00:20:16.180 --> 00:20:17.380
If you hurt their bodies,

00:20:17.980 --> 00:20:19.700
I will slaughter your entire family!

00:20:22.020 --> 00:20:23.460
You don't know if or when my family

00:20:23.460 --> 00:20:24.300
will be slaughtered.

00:20:25.020 --> 00:20:25.900
But I know

00:20:26.900 --> 00:20:27.980
every single one of yours

00:20:29.820 --> 00:20:31.380
will die very soon.

00:20:34.020 --> 00:20:34.940
- Wei Yun.
- Go away!

00:20:34.940 --> 00:20:35.780
Yun.

00:20:37.260 --> 00:20:38.100
Cao Yan,

00:20:39.140 --> 00:20:40.900
don't go too far!

00:20:41.140 --> 00:20:42.140
You wouldn't dare

00:20:42.140 --> 00:20:44.180
to kill an official right here.

00:20:47.100 --> 00:20:49.220
If you take one more step forward,

00:20:51.340 --> 00:20:53.140
I will kill you!

00:21:00.540 --> 00:21:01.380
I just did, so what?

00:21:12.700 --> 00:21:13.540
Wei Yun.

00:21:13.940 --> 00:21:15.380
No, Yun.

00:21:17.620 --> 00:21:18.460
Yun.

00:21:25.220 --> 00:21:26.100
No.

00:21:27.140 --> 00:21:28.020
Don't do that.

00:21:39.860 --> 00:21:40.700
Yun.

00:22:01.460 --> 00:22:02.300
Cao Yan.

00:22:05.900 --> 00:22:08.380
Why are you pushing us like this?

00:22:09.100 --> 00:22:11.300
Trying to exterminate us?

00:22:17.420 --> 00:22:18.300
Then, today,

00:22:19.020 --> 00:22:20.180
I will kill myself

00:22:21.420 --> 00:22:22.620
to clear our name.

00:22:24.060 --> 00:22:24.900
My family

00:22:26.540 --> 00:22:27.700
has a clear conscience.

00:22:30.860 --> 00:22:31.700
Mother!

00:22:40.620 --> 00:22:41.460
Mother!

00:22:41.700 --> 00:22:42.540
Mother.

00:22:43.180 --> 00:22:45.420
- Mother.
- Mother.

00:22:48.020 --> 00:22:48.860
Mother.

00:22:50.180 --> 00:22:51.020
Mother.

00:23:00.580 --> 00:23:01.420
Mother.

00:23:06.580 --> 00:23:07.420
Yun.

00:23:09.140 --> 00:23:09.980
Don't cry.

00:23:14.220 --> 00:23:15.620
A soldier seldom

00:23:17.340 --> 00:23:19.260
gets to be with his wife in life

00:23:20.780 --> 00:23:22.620
or see her in death.

00:23:25.020 --> 00:23:27.420
Mother has to leave you alone.

00:23:28.900 --> 00:23:30.580
I'm going to see your father.

00:23:35.900 --> 00:23:37.380
Our family rule.

00:23:40.100 --> 00:23:43.700
Our family rule.

00:23:47.220 --> 00:23:48.620
Defend the nation and the throne.

00:23:50.180 --> 00:23:51.780
Hold no regrets.

00:23:58.940 --> 00:23:59.900
Mother.

00:24:00.420 --> 00:24:01.260
Mother.

00:24:01.740 --> 00:24:02.580
Mother.

00:24:08.060 --> 00:24:09.860
Mother.

00:24:13.380 --> 00:24:14.900
Mother!

00:24:24.580 --> 00:24:25.940
This is the Wei family!

00:24:26.340 --> 00:24:27.340
Why did you do this

00:24:27.340 --> 00:24:29.260
to this family of loyal heroes?

00:24:29.420 --> 00:24:31.380
It's still in broad daylight.

00:24:31.740 --> 00:24:32.580
Cao Yan,

00:24:32.940 --> 00:24:35.180
you killed an innocent woman!

00:24:36.220 --> 00:24:37.780
You killed an innocent woman!

00:24:43.660 --> 00:24:45.100
What are you doing?

00:24:52.820 --> 00:24:54.140
Mother demonstrated with her life

00:24:55.020 --> 00:24:56.420
that we had a century-old reputation

00:24:56.820 --> 00:24:58.620
and we would never attack an official.

00:24:59.500 --> 00:25:00.340
So, we will

00:25:00.660 --> 00:25:02.380
defend their coffins with our bodies.

00:25:02.980 --> 00:25:04.140
None of us

00:25:04.540 --> 00:25:05.660
will hurt our own people.

00:25:05.900 --> 00:25:06.900
We must not fight.

00:25:25.620 --> 00:25:27.500
I'm here at the order of His Majesty.

00:25:28.060 --> 00:25:28.900
Are you

00:25:29.740 --> 00:25:31.100
trying to defy His Majesty?

00:25:34.500 --> 00:25:35.940
How dare some wives of criminals

00:25:36.260 --> 00:25:37.140
stand in my way?

00:25:38.580 --> 00:25:39.420
Get out of my way.

00:25:44.300 --> 00:25:45.140
Out of my way!

00:26:13.180 --> 00:26:14.140
Move aside.

00:26:14.140 --> 00:26:15.100
Get out of the way.

00:26:15.100 --> 00:26:15.940
Don't move.

00:26:16.100 --> 00:26:16.940
Cao Yan,

00:26:17.460 --> 00:26:19.300
you're going too far!

00:26:19.540 --> 00:26:20.900
Cao Yan, I dare you

00:26:20.900 --> 00:26:22.100
to hurt these loyal people.

00:26:23.140 --> 00:26:25.380
They defended our nation for ages.

00:26:25.460 --> 00:26:26.980
How could you deny their contributions

00:26:27.180 --> 00:26:29.980
just because of one mere defeat?

00:26:30.260 --> 00:26:31.380
- We don't agree!
- Yeah.

00:26:31.540 --> 00:26:32.380
We don't agree!

00:26:34.340 --> 00:26:35.380
- We don't!
- We don't!

00:26:35.860 --> 00:26:36.700
That's right.

00:26:36.980 --> 00:26:38.420
You're hurting innocent people.

00:26:38.700 --> 00:26:40.340
This is infuriating!

00:26:40.620 --> 00:26:41.580
These stubborn people

00:26:41.900 --> 00:26:43.020
are interfering.

00:26:43.220 --> 00:26:44.100
Take them back too!

00:26:44.460 --> 00:26:45.300
Let them go.

00:26:45.380 --> 00:26:46.220
Let go!

00:26:46.860 --> 00:26:47.740
Let go!

00:26:47.740 --> 00:26:48.660
Let them go!

00:26:48.660 --> 00:26:50.300
Let go! Let go!

00:26:50.300 --> 00:26:51.220
Back off.

00:26:51.220 --> 00:26:52.580
- Back off.
- Let go.

00:26:53.740 --> 00:26:54.580
Cao Yan.

00:26:55.700 --> 00:26:57.140
When you insulted me that day,

00:26:57.620 --> 00:26:59.100
did you see this coming?

00:26:59.380 --> 00:27:00.220
Let go.

00:27:00.980 --> 00:27:01.820
Let go.

00:27:02.460 --> 00:27:03.300
Cao Yan.

00:27:04.020 --> 00:27:04.860
Let go!

00:27:07.900 --> 00:27:08.740
Wei Yun,

00:27:09.260 --> 00:27:10.660
what else are you trying to say?

00:27:14.620 --> 00:27:15.620
Don't hurt these people.

00:27:16.820 --> 00:27:17.660
I'll go with you.

00:27:18.340 --> 00:27:19.700
- General Wei Yun.
- Don't.

00:27:20.020 --> 00:27:20.860
Yun.

00:27:21.300 --> 00:27:22.780
- Don't.
- Just don't.

00:27:22.780 --> 00:27:23.660
Yeah.

00:27:23.660 --> 00:27:24.500
Are you sure?

00:27:24.820 --> 00:27:26.340
Today, if you dare

00:27:26.340 --> 00:27:28.300
to hurt anyone present,

00:27:29.220 --> 00:27:30.620
I will kill you right here.

00:27:34.420 --> 00:27:36.020
Try me, if you dare.

00:27:48.420 --> 00:27:49.260
Take him.

00:27:49.260 --> 00:27:50.100
Yes.

00:28:05.540 --> 00:28:06.380
Cao Yan.

00:28:20.540 --> 00:28:21.380
Grand Tutor.

00:28:21.380 --> 00:28:22.660
(Xie Mingyi, the Grand Tutor)

00:28:22.660 --> 00:28:23.500
Unshackle him.

00:28:38.500 --> 00:28:39.340
Grand Tutor,

00:28:39.780 --> 00:28:40.700
what do you mean?

00:28:41.500 --> 00:28:42.740
How dare you be so impudent

00:28:43.620 --> 00:28:45.140
in front of these loyal souls?

00:28:45.900 --> 00:28:46.740
Cao Yan,

00:28:47.180 --> 00:28:49.580
the Weis aren't convicted yet.

00:28:49.660 --> 00:28:51.180
Even if they are,

00:28:51.300 --> 00:28:54.540
they'll still be a noble family.

00:28:54.780 --> 00:28:55.820
Unless His Majesty

00:28:55.900 --> 00:28:57.740
strips away their nobility,

00:28:58.220 --> 00:29:00.380
they're still the family
of Marquis of Zhenguo.

00:29:02.900 --> 00:29:06.140
Rites and laws
are the emperor's prestige.

00:29:06.540 --> 00:29:07.380
Do you

00:29:07.780 --> 00:29:09.860
show no respect for His Majesty?

00:29:10.180 --> 00:29:11.020
Grand Tutor,

00:29:11.300 --> 00:29:12.580
you get me wrong.

00:29:13.220 --> 00:29:14.740
His Majesty sent me.

00:29:15.460 --> 00:29:16.940
If I can't bring back this sinful man,

00:29:17.220 --> 00:29:19.660
I'm afraid I'll lose my life.

00:29:20.020 --> 00:29:21.940
Do you have to rush
within just one hour?

00:29:23.500 --> 00:29:24.700
Or are you actually

00:29:27.100 --> 00:29:29.380
taking revenge for yourself?

00:29:43.700 --> 00:29:44.660
I was too hasty.

00:29:44.980 --> 00:29:46.460
Grand Tutor, please don't blame me.

00:29:47.340 --> 00:29:48.860
I'm also concerned with rites and laws.

00:29:49.140 --> 00:29:50.700
But I guess we understand them

00:29:50.900 --> 00:29:51.740
in different ways.

00:29:53.820 --> 00:29:54.820
In this case,

00:29:54.980 --> 00:29:55.900
General Wei Yun...

00:29:55.900 --> 00:29:56.740
You may proceed.

00:29:57.380 --> 00:29:58.420
My men and I

00:29:59.780 --> 00:30:00.740
will wait behind you.

00:30:12.980 --> 00:30:13.820
Grand Tutor.

00:30:18.460 --> 00:30:21.380
I'd like to thank you
on behalf of my family.

00:30:22.340 --> 00:30:23.180
You...

00:30:25.580 --> 00:30:27.500
- Thank you, Grand Tutor.
- Thank you.

00:30:27.940 --> 00:30:28.780
Don't do this.

00:30:30.100 --> 00:30:30.980
Get up now.

00:30:30.980 --> 00:30:31.820
Don't do this.

00:30:32.660 --> 00:30:33.500
Get up.

00:31:14.780 --> 00:31:15.620
Since Mother died

00:31:16.700 --> 00:31:17.980
for our father-in-law,

00:31:18.820 --> 00:31:21.820
let's bury them in the same coffin.

00:31:33.110 --> 00:31:36.240
Rest in peace, Your Lordship!

00:31:36.880 --> 00:31:39.750
Rest in peace, generals!

00:31:40.750 --> 00:31:43.240
Rest in peace, Your Lordship!

00:31:44.550 --> 00:31:47.440
Rest in peace, generals!

00:32:01.740 --> 00:32:03.020
Kneel.

00:32:06.140 --> 00:32:07.380
Kowtow.

00:32:07.380 --> 00:32:08.300
(Filial piety never fades.)

00:32:08.300 --> 00:32:10.860
(Blessings linger forever.)

00:32:19.940 --> 00:32:21.620
Kowtow again.

00:32:22.940 --> 00:32:29.300
(Filial piety never fades.)

00:32:29.860 --> 00:32:31.220
I, Wei Yun, hereby swear.

00:32:32.140 --> 00:32:33.420
If I come back alive,

00:32:34.500 --> 00:32:36.060
I will live up to your expectations.

00:32:36.740 --> 00:32:37.940
I'll find out the truth,

00:32:38.660 --> 00:32:39.820
protect our family,

00:32:40.860 --> 00:32:42.220
and defend our nation.

00:32:54.380 --> 00:32:55.220
General Wei Yun,

00:32:55.860 --> 00:32:56.980
can we go now?

00:32:58.940 --> 00:32:59.900
Cao Yan,

00:32:59.900 --> 00:33:00.820
if you dare

00:33:00.820 --> 00:33:01.900
to lay one finger on him,

00:33:02.140 --> 00:33:03.980
we will become your sworn enemies.

00:33:16.900 --> 00:33:17.740
Wei Yun.

00:33:20.380 --> 00:33:21.220
Take care.

00:33:31.940 --> 00:33:33.500
Even if you're up to something,

00:33:35.900 --> 00:33:36.780
you don't need

00:33:36.780 --> 00:33:37.900
to waste your life there.

00:33:39.620 --> 00:33:40.460
Go back home.

00:33:41.140 --> 00:33:42.420
You should worry about yourself.

00:33:43.300 --> 00:33:44.420
Cao Yan won't let you off.

00:33:45.100 --> 00:33:46.460
You'll have a hard time in prison.

00:33:51.700 --> 00:33:52.780
Your family is in trouble.

00:33:53.660 --> 00:33:54.940
I won't just stand by.

00:34:00.180 --> 00:34:01.020
My sisters-in-law,

00:34:02.380 --> 00:34:03.220
take care.

00:34:04.940 --> 00:34:05.780
Yun.

00:34:51.580 --> 00:34:52.740
Whoa, easy.

00:34:54.500 --> 00:34:55.580
I just won't be.

00:34:56.820 --> 00:34:57.940
So, you'll learn your lesson.

00:34:58.500 --> 00:35:00.420
You should have protected yourself.

00:35:02.740 --> 00:35:04.580
Why didn't you take me during the day?

00:35:05.300 --> 00:35:06.220
Had I been there,

00:35:06.220 --> 00:35:07.260
I could have protected you.

00:35:09.620 --> 00:35:10.460
You?

00:35:10.780 --> 00:35:11.820
You're so hot-tempered.

00:35:11.940 --> 00:35:12.780
Had you been there,

00:35:12.780 --> 00:35:14.340
you would have fought Cao Yan.

00:35:16.340 --> 00:35:17.220
Messing with him

00:35:17.220 --> 00:35:18.220
wouldn't do you any good.

00:35:19.060 --> 00:35:20.100
I don't care.

00:35:20.500 --> 00:35:21.420
Cao Yan is

00:35:21.420 --> 00:35:22.380
a terrible guy, anyway.

00:35:23.980 --> 00:35:25.780
General Wei Yun is in prison.

00:35:26.060 --> 00:35:28.020
No one here can restrain us.

00:35:28.260 --> 00:35:29.100
Let's search around

00:35:29.140 --> 00:35:30.060
and then go back home.

00:35:30.060 --> 00:35:31.340
We can't leave now.

00:35:31.780 --> 00:35:33.380
And we must get Wei Yun out.

00:35:38.540 --> 00:35:39.560
He lost his father and brothers.

00:35:40.660 --> 00:35:41.500
Even his mother...

00:35:45.860 --> 00:35:47.220
Anyone who feels sympathy

00:35:48.420 --> 00:35:49.820
would step up like me.

00:35:52.220 --> 00:35:53.060
My Lady,

00:35:53.620 --> 00:35:54.500
did they remind you

00:35:54.500 --> 00:35:55.660
of your own father?

00:35:58.860 --> 00:35:59.980
We don't have

00:35:59.980 --> 00:36:01.100
a family rule

00:36:01.100 --> 00:36:02.700
to defend the nation or hold no regrets.

00:36:03.780 --> 00:36:04.980
Father kept telling me

00:36:05.780 --> 00:36:07.500
death was always a part of battle

00:36:07.980 --> 00:36:09.500
and I should protect myself.

00:36:15.300 --> 00:36:16.940
But everybody feels sympathy.

00:36:18.020 --> 00:36:19.420
When I just came here yesterday,

00:36:19.860 --> 00:36:20.780
I didn't understand.

00:36:22.100 --> 00:36:23.020
But anyway,

00:36:23.020 --> 00:36:23.900
they moved me.

00:36:27.140 --> 00:36:28.220
In my opinion,

00:36:29.220 --> 00:36:30.460
people defend this nation

00:36:30.460 --> 00:36:31.300
in different ways.

00:36:31.900 --> 00:36:32.740
But all in all,

00:36:33.380 --> 00:36:34.700
they share the same goal.

00:36:36.260 --> 00:36:37.100
Yeah.

00:36:38.580 --> 00:36:39.500
Some wanted to live

00:36:40.620 --> 00:36:42.220
but ended up dead.

00:36:44.300 --> 00:36:46.340
There are always people
who sacrifice for justice.

00:36:46.900 --> 00:36:48.300
Those people are heroes.

00:36:49.260 --> 00:36:50.580
Since I can't be one of them,

00:36:51.340 --> 00:36:52.740
I should protect them

00:36:53.140 --> 00:36:53.980
from being insulted.

00:36:57.780 --> 00:36:58.660
What happened today

00:36:59.220 --> 00:37:00.100
hardened my resolve

00:37:00.580 --> 00:37:01.580
to find out the truth

00:37:01.580 --> 00:37:02.740
of the crossbow case.

00:37:05.060 --> 00:37:05.980
But once we manage

00:37:05.980 --> 00:37:07.260
to get General Wei Yun out,

00:37:07.740 --> 00:37:08.780
won't it be harder

00:37:08.780 --> 00:37:09.820
to investigate that case?

00:37:09.940 --> 00:37:11.060
Only after I get Wei Yun out

00:37:11.300 --> 00:37:12.260
can I feel more secure.

00:37:15.200 --> 00:37:16.080
The Arsenal Bureau

00:37:16.080 --> 00:37:17.800
is an important military site.

00:37:18.920 --> 00:37:20.160
If Wei Yun is convicted

00:37:20.480 --> 00:37:21.320
and his family falls,

00:37:21.640 --> 00:37:23.320
the supervisor of the Arsenal Bureau

00:37:23.320 --> 00:37:24.640
will be someone else.

00:37:25.880 --> 00:37:28.480
Then, it'll be harder to sneak in.

00:37:31.440 --> 00:37:32.400
For whatever reason,

00:37:32.960 --> 00:37:34.320
I have to get Wei Yun out.

00:37:36.480 --> 00:37:37.320
Then, My Lady,

00:37:37.840 --> 00:37:39.440
have you come up with a plan?

00:37:47.960 --> 00:37:50.960
(The Court of Judicial Review)

00:37:55.320 --> 00:37:56.160
My Lord.

00:37:56.480 --> 00:37:58.320
My Lord.

00:37:58.320 --> 00:37:59.320
Please let us out.

00:38:00.000 --> 00:38:01.040
We're innocent.

00:38:01.160 --> 00:38:02.000
My Lord.

00:38:02.840 --> 00:38:03.680
My Lord.

00:38:34.240 --> 00:38:35.200
It's stuffy in here.

00:38:35.880 --> 00:38:37.680
In case you can hardly breathe,

00:38:38.200 --> 00:38:39.480
I had you attended to first.

00:38:45.280 --> 00:38:47.080
If looks could kill,

00:38:47.440 --> 00:38:48.320
I'm afraid

00:38:48.320 --> 00:38:50.160
you'd have killed me a thousand times.

00:38:56.760 --> 00:38:58.080
But under such circumstances,

00:38:59.880 --> 00:39:01.480
even if I let you down,

00:39:04.680 --> 00:39:06.360
would you dare to kill me?

00:39:11.840 --> 00:39:13.680
You never had any conflict with us.

00:39:15.560 --> 00:39:17.480
Someone must have ordered you,

00:39:18.720 --> 00:39:21.320
so you dared to exterminate us.

00:39:23.040 --> 00:39:24.080
We always handle a case

00:39:24.280 --> 00:39:25.640
under the order of authorities.

00:39:26.000 --> 00:39:26.840
But this time,

00:39:27.960 --> 00:39:29.800
it's His Majesty who gave an order.

00:39:31.960 --> 00:39:33.440
I don't think it's His Majesty.

00:39:36.440 --> 00:39:37.280
It's...

00:39:40.200 --> 00:39:41.440
The Duke of Ning.

00:39:43.480 --> 00:39:44.640
If my family falls,

00:39:46.320 --> 00:39:47.640
the one who benefits the most

00:39:48.160 --> 00:39:50.320
will be the Duke of Ning,
head of the civil officials.

00:39:58.520 --> 00:39:59.360
Cao Yan,

00:40:01.520 --> 00:40:03.800
His Majesty hates the clique thing most.

00:40:06.400 --> 00:40:08.440
You're knowingly defying him.

00:40:12.080 --> 00:40:13.680
You're truly Wei Zhong's son.

00:40:14.280 --> 00:40:15.120
Wei Yun,

00:40:15.880 --> 00:40:17.760
you're really clever.

00:40:19.080 --> 00:40:20.080
But sadly,

00:40:26.400 --> 00:40:28.400
even if you know the truth,

00:40:29.480 --> 00:40:30.920
what can you do to me?

00:40:32.360 --> 00:40:33.520
You don't think

00:40:34.400 --> 00:40:35.320
you can leave alive,

00:40:35.320 --> 00:40:36.600
do you?

00:40:53.200 --> 00:40:54.040
Wei Yun,

00:40:54.480 --> 00:40:56.120
your family got 70,000 soldiers killed.

00:40:56.680 --> 00:40:57.520
Do you or do you not

00:40:57.920 --> 00:40:58.760
plead guilty?

00:41:01.720 --> 00:41:02.920
We are innocent.

00:41:06.920 --> 00:41:07.800
Not guilty!

00:41:10.600 --> 00:41:11.600
Very well.
