00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:30.439
What are you doing here?

00:01:32.079 --> 00:01:33.000
The family isn't home.

00:01:34.519 --> 00:01:35.079
Auntie

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:36.840
We're her friends.

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:38.120
We need to talk to her.

00:01:38.359 --> 00:01:39.760
You're looking for Hui Xin?

00:01:40.879 --> 00:01:43.079
Hui Xin hasn't contacted home in ages.

00:01:43.359 --> 00:01:44.599
Her parents were so worried

00:01:44.799 --> 00:01:47.159
that they asked us to check on her.

00:01:48.159 --> 00:01:49.280
That poor girl Hui Xin...

00:01:50.599 --> 00:01:51.640
has had such a hard life.

00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:52.599
Auntie,

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:55.040
has something happened to Hui Xin?

00:01:56.439 --> 00:01:57.480
One night,

00:01:59.480 --> 00:02:00.480
she went mad.

00:02:12.879 --> 00:02:13.599
Open up!

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:22.840
Do you know what time it is? Stop the noise!

00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:24.120
Will you knock it off?

00:02:25.439 --> 00:02:27.240
I'm alone here, I'm not making noise.

00:02:27.919 --> 00:02:28.639
Alone?

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:33.960
Enough! Stop the racket!

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:35.360
I have work tomorrow!

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:36.360
Unbelievable.

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:37.840
It really wasn't me.

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:54.520
You're still denying it?

00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:56.039
The moment I got home,

00:02:56.159 --> 00:02:57.639
the noise upstairs started again.

00:02:58.080 --> 00:02:59.120
It really wasn't me.

00:02:59.199 --> 00:03:00.039
I haven't moved at all.

00:03:00.159 --> 00:03:00.960
Listen here,

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:02.120
if you keep making noise,

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:03.960
I'll have you evicted tomorrow.

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:05.120
Honestly!

00:03:05.240 --> 00:03:07.280
So annoying, always making noise!

00:03:07.599 --> 00:03:08.360
Disgusting behavior.

00:03:57.280 --> 00:03:57.919
Auntie Wei!

00:03:58.520 --> 00:03:59.159
Auntie Wei!

00:03:59.719 --> 00:04:00.520
You were right.

00:04:00.759 --> 00:04:02.319
There are strange noises in my home.

00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:04.280
I never said your home had noises.

00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:05.759
You...

00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:07.960
Didn't you just knock on my door

00:04:08.439 --> 00:04:09.680
complaining about noise?

00:04:10.199 --> 00:04:11.840
I didn't knock on your door.

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:15.919
In the middle of the night,

00:04:16.199 --> 00:04:18.199
she insisted I went upstairs to see her.

00:04:18.439 --> 00:04:19.759
But the thing is, that night

00:04:19.920 --> 00:04:22.439
I never knocked on her door.

00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:24.480
Not long after,

00:04:25.399 --> 00:04:26.959
she was taken away.

00:04:27.879 --> 00:04:28.639
Where was she taken?

00:04:32.759 --> 00:04:34.120
The mental hospital.

00:04:57.720 --> 00:04:58.279
Hello.

00:05:13.519 --> 00:05:14.720
What are you doing? Go back!

00:05:15.680 --> 00:05:16.639
Don't be afraid, don't be scared.

00:05:24.759 --> 00:05:25.319
Go on in.

00:05:29.480 --> 00:05:30.680
You only have half an hour.

00:05:31.279 --> 00:05:31.759
Okay.

00:05:46.120 --> 00:05:47.000
Hui Xin.

00:05:50.199 --> 00:05:50.959
Head... head...

00:05:51.959 --> 00:05:52.839
Head... fake...

00:05:59.360 --> 00:06:00.839
You... don't be afraid.

00:06:01.600 --> 00:06:02.920
We're here to help you.

00:06:04.480 --> 00:06:05.079
Hui Xin,

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:07.560
we heard you went to the police

00:06:07.879 --> 00:06:10.160
saying your boyfriend was possessed?

00:06:11.720 --> 00:06:12.759
Not me.

00:06:15.319 --> 00:06:16.399
Not you?

00:06:16.639 --> 00:06:17.319
It was me.

00:06:17.399 --> 00:06:18.519
I was the one who called the police.

00:06:19.399 --> 00:06:20.319
First you say it was you,

00:06:20.480 --> 00:06:21.560
then you say it wasn't you.

00:06:21.959 --> 00:06:23.639
What's really going on?

00:06:25.519 --> 00:06:27.000
I... I...

00:06:27.480 --> 00:06:28.319
I don't know.

00:06:28.879 --> 00:06:29.800
Don't ask me.

00:06:30.319 --> 00:06:31.759
I don't know anything.

00:06:32.240 --> 00:06:33.480
I don't know anything.

00:06:33.879 --> 00:06:34.439
Hui Xin,

00:06:35.439 --> 00:06:36.519
didn't you say

00:06:37.759 --> 00:06:39.360
your boyfriend had changed?

00:06:43.120 --> 00:06:44.399
Changed?

00:06:48.560 --> 00:06:50.360
I don't think so.

00:06:50.439 --> 00:06:51.480
He's not my boyfriend.

00:06:52.279 --> 00:06:54.160
His behavior, preferences...

00:06:54.600 --> 00:06:55.759
are completely different now.

00:06:55.879 --> 00:06:57.399
Was there anything different in your home?

00:06:57.720 --> 00:06:58.560
My home...

00:06:58.920 --> 00:07:00.639
I think someone else has been in my home.

00:07:01.360 --> 00:07:04.040
The teacup was moved for no reason.

00:07:04.480 --> 00:07:06.319
Even the letter I wrote suddenly vanished.

00:07:06.639 --> 00:07:07.199
Well...

00:07:08.040 --> 00:07:11.519
Maybe I was just confused.

00:07:12.600 --> 00:07:14.160
I might've put it somewhere else.

00:07:14.319 --> 00:07:15.360
I forgot.

00:07:15.399 --> 00:07:17.560
If you don't know, stop interrupting!

00:07:17.720 --> 00:07:18.480
Do you have any evidence

00:07:18.560 --> 00:07:19.560
to prove he's fake?

00:07:19.680 --> 00:07:21.519
There's a book in my drawer

00:07:22.120 --> 00:07:23.600
with a letter inside.

00:07:23.759 --> 00:07:25.000
He sent it to me before.

00:07:25.480 --> 00:07:26.920
Bring that letter here

00:07:27.040 --> 00:07:28.600
and compare it to his current handwriting.

00:07:29.360 --> 00:07:30.279
You'll see

00:07:30.439 --> 00:07:31.399
he's different now.

00:07:31.800 --> 00:07:32.319
But...

00:07:32.800 --> 00:07:35.519
Maybe he hurt his hand,

00:07:35.839 --> 00:07:37.800
that's why the writing changed.

00:07:38.199 --> 00:07:39.680
Are you stupid?

00:07:39.879 --> 00:07:41.120
These are clearly two people!

00:07:41.680 --> 00:07:42.279
Stop being so dense!

00:07:42.319 --> 00:07:42.879
Enough, stop arguing.

00:07:42.879 --> 00:07:43.959
Get your head straight.

00:07:44.959 --> 00:07:45.560
Don't worry,

00:07:45.920 --> 00:07:47.519
we'll keep the letter

00:07:48.519 --> 00:07:49.480
and investigate thoroughly.

00:08:04.600 --> 00:08:05.040
Hello?

00:08:05.920 --> 00:08:06.600
Bai Gongguan.

00:08:07.839 --> 00:08:09.319
Yes, please hold.

00:08:10.600 --> 00:08:12.360
Bai Ye, your call.

00:08:17.240 --> 00:08:17.800
Yes?

00:08:18.639 --> 00:08:20.079
They've found Hui Xin.

00:08:20.439 --> 00:08:21.279
I know.

00:08:22.199 --> 00:08:23.680
They already know.

00:08:24.279 --> 00:08:25.199
What's the next step?

00:08:27.600 --> 00:08:28.839
Wait and see.

00:08:29.920 --> 00:08:31.920
Eliminate if necessary.

00:09:16.240 --> 00:09:18.200
What's that awful smell?

00:09:19.519 --> 00:09:20.159
Keep quiet.

00:09:25.799 --> 00:09:26.360
Don't move.

00:09:27.279 --> 00:09:27.759
What?

00:09:27.960 --> 00:09:29.879
They're worshiping The Soul-Gnawer.

00:09:30.159 --> 00:09:31.120
Seriously?

00:09:31.759 --> 00:09:33.320
Isn't that the rat spirit?

00:09:34.120 --> 00:09:35.639
I heard as a child -

00:09:36.519 --> 00:09:38.080
you must wrap trimmed nails,

00:09:38.360 --> 00:09:39.360
never throw them away.

00:09:40.320 --> 00:09:41.919
If rats eat human nails,

00:09:42.320 --> 00:09:43.679
they steal your soul

00:09:44.200 --> 00:09:45.080
and take human form.

00:09:46.320 --> 00:09:47.799
Before Bai Ye and Hui Xin's incidents,

00:09:48.320 --> 00:09:49.799
and Zhang Hua's disappearance,

00:09:50.159 --> 00:09:51.840
all showed similar signs.

00:09:52.240 --> 00:09:54.399
Someone's staging this evidence

00:09:54.519 --> 00:09:56.559
to fake The Soul-Gnawer's Possession.

00:09:58.039 --> 00:09:58.559
Over here.

00:10:04.799 --> 00:10:05.600
What was that?

00:10:07.440 --> 00:10:08.000
Freeze.

00:10:09.840 --> 00:10:10.360
Take this.

00:10:23.759 --> 00:10:25.039
Who still believes in

00:10:25.039 --> 00:10:26.960
that puppet-control superstition?

00:10:26.960 --> 00:10:28.120
This goes deeper.

00:10:28.120 --> 00:10:30.440
Zhang Hua and Bai Ye are in danger.

00:10:34.159 --> 00:10:34.679
This way.

00:10:40.919 --> 00:10:42.200
Where's Hui Xin's letter?

00:10:49.039 --> 00:10:49.600
Look -

00:10:51.080 --> 00:10:51.799
the handwriting here

00:10:51.960 --> 00:10:53.559
doesn't match South Street's at all.

00:10:54.159 --> 00:10:55.159
Zhang Hua's definitely fake.

00:11:01.960 --> 00:11:03.000
Hide there, quick!

00:11:40.399 --> 00:11:41.559
That Zhang Hua's an imposter.

00:11:42.039 --> 00:11:42.960
He spotted us.

00:11:43.320 --> 00:11:44.480
We've tipped our hand.

00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:45.720
What about Grandpa?

00:11:45.919 --> 00:11:46.840
Is he in danger?

00:11:48.039 --> 00:11:48.519
Darn it!

00:11:48.879 --> 00:11:49.320
Move!

00:12:09.240 --> 00:12:09.840
Grandpa!
