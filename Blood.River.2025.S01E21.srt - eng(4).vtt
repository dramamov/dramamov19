00:01:31.620 --> 00:01:33.980
[Based on the novel of the same name from Zhou Munan's Youth in Jianghu series]

[Episode 21]

00:01:57.310 --> 00:01:59.180
I never thought you'd be this shameless.

00:01:59.870 --> 00:02:01.740
Your technique is like a mind-deranging art

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:04.100
meant to bait out the killing urge in me.

00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:07.740
Though you fought hard to hold it down,

00:02:08.710 --> 00:02:10.570
but with one look I knew

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:11.940
your whole body

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:13.820
reeks of blood.

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:15.820
You are no swordsman.

00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:18.060
All these years,

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:20.570
you've made a living by killing!

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:36.410
When the sword stirs wind,

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:38.730
he smiles as the clouds rise.

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:41.570
So many years have passed

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:43.450
and the Old City Lord's sword

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:46.060
is still this effortless and free.

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:48.010
But judging by the exchange

00:02:48.710 --> 00:02:49.500
I crossed with him just now,

00:02:49.710 --> 00:02:50.220
his swordsmanship

00:02:50.710 --> 00:02:51.690
shouldn't be that weak.

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:53.010
So Master's training

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:54.300
at the Sword Abode

00:02:54.310 --> 00:02:54.980
is starting to show,

00:02:55.630 --> 00:02:56.370
and his swordsmanship

00:02:56.800 --> 00:02:57.900
has climbed a level.

00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:00.530
You banked on no one seeing clearly

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:03.140
and pulled a dirty trick.

00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:07.060
You headed east the whole way,

00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:08.460
keeping your blade sheathed

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:11.370
to raise a swell of sword energy.

00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:14.020
Once your killing urge outweighed that energy,

00:03:14.470 --> 00:03:15.490
all that momentum dumped,

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:16.740
and you lost

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:19.140
the bravery you had.

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:20.930
You're a shameless scoundrel.

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:22.580
The Way of the Sword

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:25.020
was what your father sought.

00:03:25.710 --> 00:03:26.420
And I

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:27.580
seek only victory.

00:03:28.190 --> 00:03:29.020
For only the victor

00:03:29.390 --> 00:03:30.930
is fit to talk the Way of the Sword!

00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:31.810
The Way of the Sword

00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:33.970
is indeed the term

00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:35.530
my father often spoke of.

00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:47.860
[Sword]

00:04:04.100 --> 00:04:05.780
[Way]

00:04:07.590 --> 00:04:08.300
Sword...

00:04:09.630 --> 00:04:10.210
Way.

00:04:13.630 --> 00:04:14.250
Father,

00:04:15.710 --> 00:04:16.570
what is the Way of the Sword?

00:04:18.430 --> 00:04:21.060
By "sword" we mean skill and technique.

00:04:21.600 --> 00:04:23.660
How strong can a single blade be honed?

00:04:23.950 --> 00:04:24.930
First it strikes down ten,

00:04:25.390 --> 00:04:26.370
then a hundred,

00:04:26.870 --> 00:04:27.930
then a thousand,

00:04:28.310 --> 00:04:29.420
even ten thousand!

00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:31.660
We swordsmen

00:04:31.920 --> 00:04:32.740
train our blades

00:04:32.920 --> 00:04:34.250
day after day,

00:04:34.870 --> 00:04:35.570
hoping to push them

00:04:35.830 --> 00:04:37.490
to the utmost,

00:04:37.750 --> 00:04:39.060
so they can stand against all.

00:04:42.630 --> 00:04:43.620
I believe my sword

00:04:44.360 --> 00:04:45.100
has already reached

00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:46.780
its utmost strength.

00:04:47.830 --> 00:04:48.980
To take one step further,

00:04:49.800 --> 00:04:50.810
I must awaken to the Way.

00:04:51.920 --> 00:04:53.780
So what is the Way?

00:04:54.870 --> 00:04:56.540
The Kunlun Sword Deity once said

00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:57.740
his sword art

00:04:58.040 --> 00:04:59.180
has three realms.

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:02.300
First realm, see mountains as mountains

00:05:02.680 --> 00:05:03.740
and waters as waters.

00:05:04.510 --> 00:05:05.660
Second realm,

00:05:06.270 --> 00:05:07.620
see mountains as not mountains

00:05:08.160 --> 00:05:09.620
and waters as not waters.

00:05:10.480 --> 00:05:11.570
Third realm,

00:05:12.070 --> 00:05:13.420
see mountains still as mountains,

00:05:13.720 --> 00:05:15.780
and waters still as waters.

00:05:19.310 --> 00:05:20.450
I pondered this for long,

00:05:20.870 --> 00:05:22.690
yet never grasped its meaning.

00:05:23.830 --> 00:05:24.660
But I believed

00:05:25.360 --> 00:05:26.250
the Way

00:05:27.040 --> 00:05:29.130
is simply a reason to draw the blade.

00:05:53.510 --> 00:05:54.780
So it seems some truths...

00:05:56.240 --> 00:05:58.070
reveal themselves

00:05:58.070 --> 00:05:59.220
only in one's dying moment.

00:06:03.630 --> 00:06:05.740
The strongest strike in a life

00:06:07.600 --> 00:06:09.660
may come only once.

00:06:11.950 --> 00:06:12.740
Sadly,

00:06:14.560 --> 00:06:16.180
I can no longer protect you.

00:06:18.040 --> 00:06:19.130
I just said

00:06:19.830 --> 00:06:20.930
people of Wushuang City

00:06:22.070 --> 00:06:24.690
have no right to speak my father's name,

00:06:25.750 --> 00:06:26.810
least of you!

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:28.180
All that "flowing like water",

00:06:28.360 --> 00:06:28.930
break!

00:06:29.510 --> 00:06:31.060
All that "grandmaster aura",

00:06:31.390 --> 00:06:32.010
break!

00:06:32.720 --> 00:06:34.010
All that "peerless under heaven",

00:06:34.510 --> 00:06:35.740
all can be broken!

00:06:41.310 --> 00:06:42.810
The harder you kill now,

00:06:43.310 --> 00:06:44.660
the faster you'll lose.

00:07:04.800 --> 00:07:05.420
You've lost.

00:07:05.830 --> 00:07:07.330
You want me to use killing arts,

00:07:07.920 --> 00:07:08.890
but I refuse.

00:07:09.630 --> 00:07:10.130
Today,

00:07:10.510 --> 00:07:11.890
I'll beat you with the sword alone.

00:07:20.870 --> 00:07:21.490
It's him!

00:07:22.430 --> 00:07:23.330
You know him?

00:07:25.070 --> 00:07:25.980
He's Blood River's Umbrella Ghost,

00:07:26.680 --> 00:07:27.620
Su Muyu.

00:07:28.950 --> 00:07:29.780
Blood River...

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:32.220
If he's truly from Blood River,

00:07:33.750 --> 00:07:35.890
then everything makes sense.

00:07:37.800 --> 00:07:38.570
Elder Jian,

00:07:39.190 --> 00:07:40.010
what do you mean?

00:07:40.430 --> 00:07:41.060
Are you saying

00:07:41.510 --> 00:07:42.540
Wushuang City and Blood River

00:07:42.600 --> 00:07:43.490
are entangled?

00:07:43.720 --> 00:07:44.370
And it even ties

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:46.300
to No-Sword City?

00:07:46.950 --> 00:07:48.490
Sir, there's no need to ask.

00:07:48.950 --> 00:07:50.660
It's all in the past.

00:07:53.160 --> 00:07:53.780
Master,

00:07:54.040 --> 00:07:55.450
the sword coffer's slipping control!

00:07:59.190 --> 00:07:59.860
It only spotted

00:07:59.870 --> 00:08:01.100
a worthy opponent

00:08:01.800 --> 00:08:02.930
and wants a match.

00:08:04.950 --> 00:08:06.130
It's a pity you're still young.

00:08:06.800 --> 00:08:07.620
Otherwise, such an opponent

00:08:08.430 --> 00:08:09.620
is truly worth a fight.

00:08:10.750 --> 00:08:11.370
Master,

00:08:11.800 --> 00:08:12.620
what should we do?

00:08:13.160 --> 00:08:13.810
Don't worry.

00:08:14.190 --> 00:08:14.890
It won't be long

00:08:15.160 --> 00:08:16.180
before it settles down.

00:08:18.240 --> 00:08:18.890
Little Wushuang,

00:08:20.120 --> 00:08:21.220
when you're grown,

00:08:21.600 --> 00:08:22.690
take it to seek

00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:24.250
a worthy opponent.

00:08:25.920 --> 00:08:26.660
The Old City Lord

00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:27.860
is about to lose.

00:08:35.480 --> 00:08:36.660
He should have lost.

00:08:37.440 --> 00:08:38.380
Only this loss

00:08:39.480 --> 00:08:40.660
came a dozen years late.

00:08:42.320 --> 00:08:43.300
Had he lost back then,

00:08:44.030 --> 00:08:45.540
he might have risen again.

00:08:46.360 --> 00:08:47.300
But losing today,

00:08:48.630 --> 00:08:49.850
he loses for good.

00:09:00.200 --> 00:09:00.780
Here it comes...

00:09:00.870 --> 00:09:02.330
the Old City Lord's strongest strike.

00:09:03.750 --> 00:09:05.260
Riding the sword to the Ninth Heaven...

00:09:06.080 --> 00:09:08.090
The dragon falls into the Yellow Springs!

00:09:12.910 --> 00:09:14.420
You're the one who will fall!

00:09:26.630 --> 00:09:27.330
It's over.

00:09:33.200 --> 00:09:33.930
Jade Ruyi!

00:09:38.150 --> 00:09:39.540
Such pure sword energy!

00:09:44.120 --> 00:09:44.780
Master,

00:09:45.960 --> 00:09:46.730
why was the sword coffer

00:09:47.150 --> 00:09:48.300
acting by itself?

00:09:48.510 --> 00:09:50.140
It wasn't the coffer

00:09:50.150 --> 00:09:51.140
acting on its own.

00:09:51.550 --> 00:09:53.210
Without noticing,

00:09:53.510 --> 00:09:55.060
you stirred it.

00:09:55.600 --> 00:09:56.300
These last two days,

00:09:56.840 --> 00:09:57.900
I only taught little Wushuang

00:09:57.960 --> 00:09:59.420
some basic inner work.

00:10:00.750 --> 00:10:01.570
Did the Jade Ruyi

00:10:01.790 --> 00:10:03.330
shift the battle below?

00:10:11.670 --> 00:10:12.420
Stop!

00:10:24.440 --> 00:10:25.540
My killing intent has faded,

00:10:26.480 --> 00:10:27.300
and my sword momentum is gone.

00:10:27.910 --> 00:10:29.180
If you strike now,

00:10:29.720 --> 00:10:30.660
I'll surely lose.

00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:31.730
I know.

00:10:32.510 --> 00:10:33.970
But I won't hit a man when he's down.

00:10:34.910 --> 00:10:35.780
I only ask you

00:10:36.630 --> 00:10:37.900
to spare my master's life.

00:10:38.790 --> 00:10:40.300
Spare your master?

00:10:44.360 --> 00:10:45.380
Back when your master

00:10:45.400 --> 00:10:46.390
slaughtered everyone

00:10:46.390 --> 00:10:47.540
in No-Sword City,

00:10:49.310 --> 00:10:51.330
did he spare theirs?

00:10:52.830 --> 00:10:53.810
You're right.

00:10:54.670 --> 00:10:56.060
My master's deeds back then

00:10:56.390 --> 00:10:57.570
were truly unforgivable.

00:10:58.240 --> 00:10:59.570
But as his disciple,

00:10:59.900 --> 00:11:00.630
how could I possibly

00:11:00.630 --> 00:11:02.020
watch my master be killed

00:11:02.150 --> 00:11:03.540
before my eyes?

00:11:05.630 --> 00:11:07.060
I hope you can understand.

00:11:08.550 --> 00:11:09.450
And my master

00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:12.500
has his inner channels destroyed.

00:11:13.320 --> 00:11:14.210
He lives now

00:11:14.550 --> 00:11:16.730
only by a thread of qi within him.

00:11:17.030 --> 00:11:18.540
He won't last many days.

00:11:19.440 --> 00:11:20.090
Mr. Zhuo,

00:11:20.720 --> 00:11:22.500
why strike that final blow?

00:11:23.550 --> 00:11:24.660
A swordsman's death

00:11:26.550 --> 00:11:28.180
is not the body's death,

00:11:29.270 --> 00:11:30.780
but his sword-heart's.

00:11:31.840 --> 00:11:33.500
I've crushed Liu Yunqi's sword-heart.

00:11:33.790 --> 00:11:35.690
He can never wield a sword again.

00:11:37.480 --> 00:11:38.540
He is already dead.

00:11:39.270 --> 00:11:40.020
Yes.

00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:43.850
Thank you, Mr. Zhuo.

00:11:44.630 --> 00:11:45.850
We've actually met.

00:11:47.240 --> 00:11:47.930
Yes.

00:11:48.550 --> 00:11:49.850
When we stood against the Demonic Sect,

00:11:50.840 --> 00:11:52.300
I saw your swordsmanship.

00:11:53.150 --> 00:11:53.840
Since you've come

00:11:53.840 --> 00:11:55.090
under the name Zhuo Yue'an,

00:11:55.670 --> 00:11:56.850
then you are Zhuo Yue'an.

00:11:57.870 --> 00:11:58.780
I admire you.

00:11:59.910 --> 00:12:01.420
You're unlike your master.

00:12:02.030 --> 00:12:03.780
Your swordsmanship holds little malice.

00:12:04.320 --> 00:12:05.900
But you shoulder too much,

00:12:06.240 --> 00:12:07.850
so the blade can't follow your heart

00:12:09.150 --> 00:12:10.390
and you never reach

00:12:10.390 --> 00:12:11.690
your strongest state.

00:12:12.200 --> 00:12:13.420
Many have said the same.

00:12:15.150 --> 00:12:16.060
Since the elders

00:12:16.840 --> 00:12:18.210
entrusted Wushuang City to me,

00:12:19.320 --> 00:12:20.330
I've had to place

00:12:20.330 --> 00:12:21.540
its honor and shame

00:12:22.510 --> 00:12:24.260
on this very sword.

00:12:25.910 --> 00:12:27.420
Peerless Under Heaven...

00:12:28.670 --> 00:12:30.520
I heard the White-Feather Sword Deity

00:12:30.520 --> 00:12:31.820
once saved a disciple

00:12:31.820 --> 00:12:32.730
on Tianqi City's execution ground.

00:12:33.630 --> 00:12:34.450
As he left,

00:12:35.320 --> 00:12:37.090
he cut down the plaque above with one stroke.

00:12:37.870 --> 00:12:38.660
So today,

00:12:40.240 --> 00:12:40.970
if I sever these characters

00:12:41.120 --> 00:12:42.380
with one stroke,

00:12:42.750 --> 00:12:43.930
the name No-Sword City

00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:46.380
will once again ring through

00:12:46.480 --> 00:12:47.420
the martial world.

00:12:47.790 --> 00:12:48.450
Sir,

00:12:48.910 --> 00:12:49.970
please don't act rashly.

00:12:51.200 --> 00:12:51.850
Seven days from now,

00:12:52.150 --> 00:12:53.180
you and I will fight.

00:12:53.630 --> 00:12:54.500
If you lose,

00:12:54.910 --> 00:12:56.300
I'll cut them down.

00:12:56.750 --> 00:12:57.380
Very well.

00:12:57.720 --> 00:12:58.450
Seven days from now,

00:12:58.750 --> 00:13:00.420
by the Sword Abode behind Wushuang City,

00:13:00.910 --> 00:13:02.660
I'll see your swordsmanship.

00:13:03.720 --> 00:13:04.380
Good.

00:13:16.360 --> 00:13:17.140
This kid...

00:13:18.030 --> 00:13:18.900
After changing his name,

00:13:19.200 --> 00:13:21.180
he acts like a different man.

00:13:21.750 --> 00:13:23.500
Challenging Wushuang City was one thing,

00:13:24.030 --> 00:13:25.140
he even crippled

00:13:25.140 --> 00:13:26.180
the Old City Lord.

00:13:28.030 --> 00:13:29.090
Too arrogant!

00:13:29.840 --> 00:13:30.780
Too overbearing!

00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:32.580
Had he been like this earlier,

00:13:32.580 --> 00:13:33.930
we'd have crushed the three families already.

00:13:34.240 --> 00:13:34.900
Yeah.

00:13:35.720 --> 00:13:37.570
Muyu never liked the spotlight,

00:13:37.630 --> 00:13:38.330
but this time

00:13:38.390 --> 00:13:39.540
the whole world is talking

00:13:39.540 --> 00:13:41.260
about Zhuo Yue'an of No-Sword City.

00:13:43.910 --> 00:13:45.020
However...

00:13:46.790 --> 00:13:47.730
What?

00:13:49.480 --> 00:13:50.760
The move Muyu used

00:13:50.760 --> 00:13:51.750
at the last moment

00:13:51.910 --> 00:13:53.180
looked like the Eighteen-Sword Array.

00:13:53.790 --> 00:13:55.010
Back when we helped the sects

00:13:55.010 --> 00:13:56.330
resist the Demonic Sect's eastern campaign,

00:13:56.720 --> 00:13:57.840
Muyu once used

00:13:57.840 --> 00:13:59.090
that very array in public.

00:13:59.790 --> 00:14:02.500
So some folks are quietly saying

00:14:03.120 --> 00:14:04.970
that Zhuo Yue'an, No-Sword City's heir,

00:14:05.120 --> 00:14:06.300
is Blood River's Umbrella Ghost.

00:14:07.240 --> 00:14:08.320
But that guess

00:14:08.320 --> 00:14:09.330
is far too absurd,

00:14:09.840 --> 00:14:11.210
and many won't believe it.

00:14:15.240 --> 00:14:16.690
An assassin

00:14:16.870 --> 00:14:18.970
who walks the night and kills without a sound

00:14:19.270 --> 00:14:21.570
now shows up openly under the sun,

00:14:22.270 --> 00:14:24.420
even challenging a once-glorious sect...

00:14:26.670 --> 00:14:28.660
Sounds a bit like a tall tale.

00:14:29.750 --> 00:14:30.640
If he's finished the job,

00:14:30.640 --> 00:14:31.570
he should be back by now, right?

00:14:32.360 --> 00:14:33.060
Oh,

00:14:33.750 --> 00:14:34.660
maybe...

00:14:34.870 --> 00:14:36.060
he went straight back to Nan'an?

00:14:36.360 --> 00:14:37.020
No.

00:14:37.510 --> 00:14:40.060
Muyu set another duel with City Lord, Song Yanhui,

00:14:40.480 --> 00:14:41.970
a solo fight on Wushuang City's back mountain.

00:14:44.200 --> 00:14:45.730
Su Muyu's lost his mind?

00:14:47.150 --> 00:14:48.660
The City Lord of Wushuang

00:14:49.120 --> 00:14:50.690
won't be easy to handle.

00:14:51.200 --> 00:14:52.140
This time

00:14:52.240 --> 00:14:53.730
Muyu really caught the competitive bug.

00:14:54.720 --> 00:14:55.380
No.

00:14:55.960 --> 00:14:56.810
That's not what I mean.

00:14:58.790 --> 00:14:59.930
I mean,

00:15:00.600 --> 00:15:02.300
Song Yanhui is nothing

00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:04.140
worth waiting around for.

00:15:05.120 --> 00:15:06.450
When we fought the Demonic Sect,

00:15:06.480 --> 00:15:08.210
we'd already seen his skills.

00:15:08.790 --> 00:15:11.090
If he truly wants his sword to shake the world,

00:15:11.600 --> 00:15:13.450
why not head to Xueyue City

00:15:13.510 --> 00:15:14.780
and teach that brat a lesson?

00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:18.810
Still, this isn't bad either.

00:15:19.750 --> 00:15:20.730
Old pain

00:15:20.960 --> 00:15:22.660
should be cut off someday.

00:15:24.080 --> 00:15:24.690
Otherwise,

00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:25.910
he'll carry

00:15:25.910 --> 00:15:27.540
that grudge for life.

00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:29.780
And...

00:15:32.080 --> 00:15:33.420
I've been waiting for that day too.

00:15:35.360 --> 00:15:37.140
I've long known who he is,

00:15:37.550 --> 00:15:38.660
but he doesn't know

00:15:39.320 --> 00:15:41.420
who destroyed No-Sword City.

00:15:42.120 --> 00:15:43.810
From how he's moving now,

00:15:44.550 --> 00:15:46.020
he must've found out

00:15:46.510 --> 00:15:48.300
Wushuang City was behind it.

00:15:49.440 --> 00:15:50.300
Wushuang City is unworthy

00:15:50.550 --> 00:15:52.660
of "Peerless Under Heaven" long ago.

00:15:54.240 --> 00:15:54.850
Still,

00:15:55.670 --> 00:15:56.570
Liu Yunqi's defeat

00:15:57.670 --> 00:15:58.380
isn't the end.

00:16:00.270 --> 00:16:01.020
What else?

00:16:01.720 --> 00:16:02.850
Su Muyu and Song Yanhui

00:16:02.870 --> 00:16:03.660
agreed:

00:16:04.120 --> 00:16:04.970
four days from now,

00:16:05.360 --> 00:16:06.380
on Wushuang City's back mountain,

00:16:07.030 --> 00:16:07.730
they'll fight again.

00:16:20.750 --> 00:16:21.900
Maybe true vengeance

00:16:23.670 --> 00:16:25.140
would be to wipe out Wushuang City,

00:16:26.790 --> 00:16:27.850
but I won't,

00:16:31.080 --> 00:16:32.610
and I know you won't, Father.

00:16:35.810 --> 00:16:36.900
After all, Wushuang City

00:16:38.270 --> 00:16:40.210
isn't full of Liu Yunqi types.

00:16:42.200 --> 00:16:43.380
And killing to stop killing...

00:16:46.360 --> 00:16:47.610
never ends.

00:16:50.480 --> 00:16:51.330
You've done well,

00:16:52.150 --> 00:16:53.020
my son.

00:16:56.270 --> 00:16:57.180
Father...

00:16:58.200 --> 00:17:00.380
I don't want you living in hatred.

00:17:01.150 --> 00:17:02.180
Just be yourself

00:17:02.480 --> 00:17:04.090
after the debt here is paid.

00:17:04.830 --> 00:17:07.170
Don't shoulder those old grudges.

00:17:13.310 --> 00:17:14.300
Son, look.

00:17:15.660 --> 00:17:19.460
♪I almost lost myself...♪

00:17:20.240 --> 00:17:21.740
After tonight's moon sets in the west,

00:17:22.790 --> 00:17:23.500
tomorrow

00:17:24.510 --> 00:17:26.130
still brings a brand-new sunrise.

00:17:36.880 --> 00:17:37.650
Didn't expect

00:17:37.880 --> 00:17:38.610
that guy

00:17:38.880 --> 00:17:40.850
to really challenge Wushuang City.

00:17:41.750 --> 00:17:42.940
He challenges Wushuang City

00:17:43.400 --> 00:17:44.370
and fame follows.

00:17:45.310 --> 00:17:46.130
What are you so proud of?

00:17:47.310 --> 00:17:48.760
But Zhuo Yue'an...

00:17:49.090 --> 00:17:50.420
Who is he?

00:17:51.830 --> 00:17:52.500
I never heard of him.

00:17:53.510 --> 00:17:55.940
Zhuo Yue'an is Su Muyu.

00:17:57.070 --> 00:17:59.260
He was heir to No-Sword City.

00:17:59.880 --> 00:18:01.410
And if not for sudden calamity,

00:18:02.030 --> 00:18:02.890
when grown

00:18:03.510 --> 00:18:05.700
he'd surely have entered the Academy.

00:18:07.160 --> 00:18:08.300
Fate toys with us.

00:18:09.590 --> 00:18:10.220
So,

00:18:11.310 --> 00:18:13.220
you're going to watch the show?

00:18:16.070 --> 00:18:18.330
Going into Wushuang City as I am,

00:18:18.920 --> 00:18:20.130
if anyone recognizes me,

00:18:20.480 --> 00:18:21.610
it'll be big trouble.

00:18:23.750 --> 00:18:24.980
Then what are you excited about?

00:18:26.000 --> 00:18:27.090
Because this spectacle

00:18:27.750 --> 00:18:29.330
was egged on by someone.

00:18:30.440 --> 00:18:31.980
He wants to use Su Muyu's sword

00:18:32.310 --> 00:18:34.330
to spark chaos in Wushuang City.

00:18:35.140 --> 00:18:38.420
[Flying Tiger General's Residence]

00:18:39.160 --> 00:18:40.350
Wushuang City

00:18:40.880 --> 00:18:43.090
was once the foremost city.

00:18:44.240 --> 00:18:46.260
Its martial path may have declined,

00:18:46.750 --> 00:18:50.170
but in craft and devices, it's still second to none.

00:18:51.200 --> 00:18:53.700
We've eyed this fat prize for years,

00:18:54.510 --> 00:18:57.300
and it's time to swallow it.

00:19:01.000 --> 00:19:03.130
Ruled by a madman only craving victory

00:19:04.030 --> 00:19:06.260
and a fool shackled by trifles,

00:19:09.830 --> 00:19:11.170
the sky over Wushuang City

00:19:12.110 --> 00:19:13.700
is long due for a change.

00:19:15.270 --> 00:19:16.220
Only now

00:19:17.480 --> 00:19:19.460
we can ride Su...

00:19:20.480 --> 00:19:21.260
no...

00:19:25.000 --> 00:19:26.410
Zhuo Yue'an's rise.

00:19:28.110 --> 00:19:28.740
And then,

00:19:30.110 --> 00:19:30.890
that man

00:19:31.200 --> 00:19:32.370
can profit from it.

00:19:32.880 --> 00:19:33.460
Besides,

00:19:34.070 --> 00:19:36.410
he's a man of the court.

00:19:36.920 --> 00:19:37.700
You told me

00:19:37.830 --> 00:19:38.700
about this before.

00:19:39.270 --> 00:19:40.700
Earlier I wanted to send men to Wushuang City,

00:19:40.960 --> 00:19:41.850
and you stopped me.

00:19:42.480 --> 00:19:43.130
This time,

00:19:43.790 --> 00:19:44.540
what's the plan?

00:19:45.480 --> 00:19:46.890
What he didn't expect is,

00:19:47.750 --> 00:19:48.460
Su Muyu

00:19:48.640 --> 00:19:49.890
told me the fact

00:19:50.000 --> 00:19:50.610
that someone planned

00:19:50.680 --> 00:19:51.410
to use him.

00:19:51.720 --> 00:19:53.540
I've prepared in advance.

00:19:53.920 --> 00:19:56.300
Since he wants Wushuang City in chaos,

00:19:56.790 --> 00:19:57.610
fine...

00:19:58.350 --> 00:20:00.370
let's make it even messier.

00:20:02.110 --> 00:20:02.980
How?

00:20:04.720 --> 00:20:05.460
Guards.

00:20:06.720 --> 00:20:07.300
Your Highness.

00:20:08.110 --> 00:20:09.300
How goes Sihuai City?

00:20:09.750 --> 00:20:10.370
Our people have courted

00:20:10.590 --> 00:20:12.500
the City Lord's senior disciple for years.

00:20:13.110 --> 00:20:13.780
Frankly, the man

00:20:14.000 --> 00:20:15.130
is a brainless incompetent,

00:20:15.270 --> 00:20:16.020
easy to turn.

00:20:16.640 --> 00:20:17.330
As for the other one,

00:20:17.790 --> 00:20:18.500
he's out of seclusion

00:20:19.000 --> 00:20:21.020
and willing to lend us a sword.

00:20:21.310 --> 00:20:22.460
What of Su Changhe?

00:20:23.550 --> 00:20:24.700
Any sign of movement?

00:20:25.000 --> 00:20:26.610
The Blood River are truly secretive.

00:20:26.960 --> 00:20:28.020
We've found

00:20:28.160 --> 00:20:28.940
only scattered traces,

00:20:29.310 --> 00:20:29.980
but...

00:20:30.270 --> 00:20:32.060
they're surely heading toward Sihuai City.

00:20:41.270 --> 00:20:42.410
A contest of the Way of the Sword

00:20:42.440 --> 00:20:44.170
without a living Sword Deity,

00:20:44.790 --> 00:20:46.650
what's the fun in that?

00:20:51.030 --> 00:20:51.500
Very well.

00:20:51.880 --> 00:20:52.610
Then let's await

00:20:52.640 --> 00:20:53.940
the Sword Deities to gather

00:20:54.070 --> 00:20:55.130
at Wushuang City.

00:21:04.720 --> 00:21:05.980
The real game

00:21:07.200 --> 00:21:09.020
is about to begin.

00:21:11.030 --> 00:21:11.780
What matter?

00:21:12.510 --> 00:21:14.540
Su Muyu, head of Blood River's Su family,

00:21:14.750 --> 00:21:15.890
has challenged Wushuang City.

00:21:16.880 --> 00:21:18.370
He'll duel the City Lord,

00:21:18.510 --> 00:21:19.850
Song Yanhui.

00:21:25.480 --> 00:21:26.500
I hate you all,

00:21:27.550 --> 00:21:29.780
but that Ji Ruofeng isn't bad.

00:21:30.790 --> 00:21:31.410
Speak,

00:21:32.270 --> 00:21:33.090
what brings you

00:21:33.720 --> 00:21:34.460
this time?

00:21:34.920 --> 00:21:36.650
Our master has no business for you,

00:21:37.160 --> 00:21:39.300
only a bit of sport,

00:21:39.480 --> 00:21:40.370
lest you miss it.

00:21:41.000 --> 00:21:43.780
A sword-related spectacle.

00:21:44.790 --> 00:21:46.170
A worldly matter?

00:21:48.790 --> 00:21:49.500
Leader Lv!

00:21:51.720 --> 00:21:52.410
Master.

00:22:01.580 --> 00:22:05.140
[Zhao Yuzhen of Wangchengshan Sect]

00:22:06.830 --> 00:22:07.570
Honored guest,

00:22:08.160 --> 00:22:09.090
what news do you bring from afar?

00:22:09.830 --> 00:22:10.780
Greetings, Profound Sword Deity.

00:22:11.590 --> 00:22:12.940
Ji Ruofeng

00:22:13.160 --> 00:22:14.540
may have planted spies

00:22:14.880 --> 00:22:16.130
on my sect.

00:22:17.030 --> 00:22:19.300
My good disciple hasn't even left the mountain,

00:22:20.070 --> 00:22:22.130
nor sparred with anyone.

00:22:23.270 --> 00:22:24.410
Yet somehow,

00:22:24.720 --> 00:22:27.170
he's been dubbed the Profound Sword Deity.

00:22:27.270 --> 00:22:29.130
And my once-secluded

00:22:29.310 --> 00:22:31.560
Wangchengshan Sect

00:22:32.110 --> 00:22:33.260
knows no peace anymore.

00:22:34.110 --> 00:22:34.780
Master,

00:22:35.200 --> 00:22:36.260
don't be so fierce.

00:22:36.720 --> 00:22:37.570
He's a guest from afar.

00:22:39.550 --> 00:22:40.540
I'm ordered by our master

00:22:40.960 --> 00:22:42.300
to bring a message to the Profound Sword Deity.

00:22:43.160 --> 00:22:43.740
Speak, then.

00:22:44.110 --> 00:22:45.220
Su Muyu, head of the Su family,

00:22:45.510 --> 00:22:46.330
challenged Wushuang City.

00:22:46.960 --> 00:22:48.980
He fought the former City Lord, Liu Yunqi,

00:22:49.200 --> 00:22:49.780
and won.

00:22:50.400 --> 00:22:51.890
He then set a duel with the current City Lord,

00:22:52.200 --> 00:22:52.850
Song Yanhui.

00:22:54.030 --> 00:22:56.220
What has that to do with my sect?

00:22:56.880 --> 00:22:58.780
Go tell Ji Ruofeng this:

00:22:59.240 --> 00:23:01.410
if he makes trouble here again,

00:23:02.110 --> 00:23:03.260
I'll go to Tianqi

00:23:03.260 --> 00:23:05.020
and smash his Baixiao Hall.

00:23:07.000 --> 00:23:09.090
Master Ji wishes to invite you to watch?

00:23:11.240 --> 00:23:12.700
But I cannot leave this mountain.

00:23:13.090 --> 00:23:14.460
And surely the all-knowing Master Ji

00:23:14.720 --> 00:23:15.650
knows that.

00:23:16.070 --> 00:23:17.810
He's invited several other Sword Deities too,

00:23:18.510 --> 00:23:19.500
because he believes

00:23:19.790 --> 00:23:20.460
this duel

00:23:20.920 --> 00:23:22.190
may well birth

00:23:22.190 --> 00:23:23.650
another Sword Deity.

00:23:24.510 --> 00:23:25.370
If overnight

00:23:25.590 --> 00:23:27.220
the jianghu boast six Sword Deities,

00:23:27.790 --> 00:23:29.700
wouldn't that be something?

00:23:30.720 --> 00:23:31.940
Sword Deity...

00:23:34.880 --> 00:23:35.980
She'll go, no doubt.

00:23:36.830 --> 00:23:38.300
No one loves the sword like she does.

00:23:44.880 --> 00:23:45.500
Master...

00:23:59.590 --> 00:24:00.410
Very well.

00:24:01.240 --> 00:24:02.700
Decide for yourself.

00:24:20.030 --> 00:24:20.850
Tell Master Ji

00:24:21.350 --> 00:24:22.260
that I understand.

00:24:24.350 --> 00:24:25.060
Got it.

00:24:44.030 --> 00:24:44.700
Move.

00:25:02.590 --> 00:25:03.260
Spider Woman

00:25:03.350 --> 00:25:03.940
of Blood River...

00:25:04.350 --> 00:25:06.060
Baixiao Hall's intel is truly sharp.

00:25:06.480 --> 00:25:07.890
You pegged me at first glance.

00:25:08.720 --> 00:25:09.780
I heard you've been visiting

00:25:09.780 --> 00:25:11.170
Sword Deities everywhere,

00:25:11.960 --> 00:25:13.610
so I waited here.

00:25:14.480 --> 00:25:16.370
And I lucked out.

00:25:16.920 --> 00:25:17.540
So you came

00:25:17.590 --> 00:25:18.650
to buy news from Baixiao Hall?

00:25:19.070 --> 00:25:20.020
Pick any branch,

00:25:20.070 --> 00:25:20.740
pay and get what you want.

00:25:20.960 --> 00:25:21.650
Why block my path?

00:25:22.270 --> 00:25:23.260
As if I don't know.

00:25:24.830 --> 00:25:25.890
Your Baixiao Hall

00:25:26.110 --> 00:25:27.270
seems to have some dirty ties

00:25:27.270 --> 00:25:28.220
to the Inner Security Division,

00:25:29.160 --> 00:25:30.650
and certain news is never for sale.

00:25:31.440 --> 00:25:32.370
What you want to know

00:25:32.960 --> 00:25:33.570
is about...

00:25:33.680 --> 00:25:34.540
The Xuanwu Guardian,

00:25:36.440 --> 00:25:37.260
Tang Lianyue.

00:25:39.400 --> 00:25:40.700
If you won't share it,

00:25:41.160 --> 00:25:41.980
fine.

00:25:43.550 --> 00:25:44.300
I'll find a way

00:25:45.350 --> 00:25:46.980
to make you.

00:25:50.400 --> 00:25:50.810
Hey...

00:25:51.070 --> 00:25:52.610
Go ask your master.

00:25:53.200 --> 00:25:53.810
You'll get the antidote

00:25:54.510 --> 00:25:55.410
next time.

00:26:17.960 --> 00:26:18.500
Master.

00:26:18.510 --> 00:26:19.320
Yanhui.

00:26:19.320 --> 00:26:20.020
You're awake.

00:26:20.200 --> 00:26:21.740
Will you blame me?

00:26:23.450 --> 00:26:25.350
You wanted to roam the world

00:26:26.510 --> 00:26:28.890
as a knight-errant,

00:26:31.400 --> 00:26:32.730
yet I kept you

00:26:32.730 --> 00:26:34.780
here in Wushuang City,

00:26:35.830 --> 00:26:37.940
burdened you with its honor and shame.

00:26:42.270 --> 00:26:42.980
Master,

00:26:44.310 --> 00:26:45.020
is it

00:26:46.350 --> 00:26:47.980
really so important

00:26:49.550 --> 00:26:50.980
that Wushuang City be number one?

00:26:51.550 --> 00:26:53.570
But you are different.

00:26:55.270 --> 00:26:56.090
Yanhui,

00:26:56.960 --> 00:26:58.890
from the day I met you,

00:26:59.830 --> 00:27:00.780
I knew

00:27:01.750 --> 00:27:02.700
you could change

00:27:02.750 --> 00:27:03.980
all of this.

00:27:04.590 --> 00:27:05.300
You're no worse

00:27:05.440 --> 00:27:06.890
than any of them.

00:27:07.640 --> 00:27:08.940
You were born

00:27:10.510 --> 00:27:12.740
for the sword.

00:27:14.070 --> 00:27:15.700
But I often regret

00:27:17.000 --> 00:27:17.980
whether

00:27:19.550 --> 00:27:21.650
I pressed you too hard,

00:27:23.200 --> 00:27:24.410
leaving you unable

00:27:25.510 --> 00:27:27.330
to be as free as they are.

00:27:29.030 --> 00:27:30.430
In your sword-heart,

00:27:30.430 --> 00:27:32.130
you aren't as pure.

00:27:34.830 --> 00:27:36.890
You shouldn't have accepted his duel.

00:27:38.790 --> 00:27:39.460
Master...

00:27:39.640 --> 00:27:40.170
Master...

00:27:42.350 --> 00:27:44.260
You shouldn't have agreed to fight him.

00:27:45.000 --> 00:27:46.170
Do you understand?

00:27:48.310 --> 00:27:49.260
Master,

00:27:49.480 --> 00:27:50.570
don't get so worked up.

00:27:51.400 --> 00:27:52.090
Don't forget...

00:27:53.030 --> 00:27:54.260
I still have one trump move

00:27:54.310 --> 00:27:55.170
left unused.

00:27:57.510 --> 00:27:58.610
You mean...

00:27:59.510 --> 00:28:01.300
the Wither-Bloom Sword Art?

00:28:05.110 --> 00:28:06.540
You're being reckless.

00:28:07.160 --> 00:28:08.780
That will cost your life.

00:28:09.110 --> 00:28:09.980
I'll die,

00:28:11.200 --> 00:28:12.170
but I won't lose.

00:28:12.960 --> 00:28:14.020
With my death,

00:28:14.830 --> 00:28:16.650
I'll keep Wushuang City's honor.

00:28:17.750 --> 00:28:20.060
That's my duty as City Lord.

00:28:22.400 --> 00:28:23.540
Your disciple

00:28:25.480 --> 00:28:27.500
can open the Peerless Sword Coffer.

00:28:28.350 --> 00:28:29.390
Maybe let him...

00:28:29.390 --> 00:28:30.260
Master,

00:28:32.120 --> 00:28:33.780
Wushuang's still too young.

00:28:35.110 --> 00:28:36.060
As the teacher,

00:28:37.640 --> 00:28:39.300
I should go before my disciple.

00:28:41.880 --> 00:28:43.330
You did the same for me.

00:28:44.240 --> 00:28:45.060
Besides,

00:28:46.650 --> 00:28:47.620
I don't want Wushuang

00:28:47.620 --> 00:28:49.280
to walk my old path again.

00:28:51.310 --> 00:28:53.020
I want him to choose his own way.

00:28:57.510 --> 00:28:59.020
As for Wushuang City's future,

00:29:00.830 --> 00:29:02.940
leave it to the young.

00:29:05.830 --> 00:29:06.780
All right.

00:29:08.510 --> 00:29:09.460
Very well.

00:29:12.270 --> 00:29:13.850
Have it your way.

00:29:17.030 --> 00:29:18.260
All my life,

00:29:19.920 --> 00:29:23.700
I mostly did wrong.

00:29:24.510 --> 00:29:25.780
I hope you all

00:29:27.680 --> 00:29:30.170
won't repeat my mistakes.

00:30:14.140 --> 00:30:25.350
[All Blessings Attained]

00:30:25.350 --> 00:30:26.370
Master!

00:30:46.000 --> 00:30:48.090
Sihuai City's packed lately.

00:30:50.160 --> 00:30:51.020
Sects from everywhere

00:30:51.550 --> 00:30:52.610
are flooding in,

00:30:52.720 --> 00:30:53.410
too many to count.

00:30:54.310 --> 00:30:55.500
All want into the Tianxia Casino

00:30:56.110 --> 00:30:56.890
to get a Wushuang Token.

00:30:59.440 --> 00:31:00.610
Business must be booming, right?

00:31:02.350 --> 00:31:03.540
It was a big deal at first.

00:31:04.270 --> 00:31:05.260
But among the crowd

00:31:05.590 --> 00:31:06.780
are even great sect leaders

00:31:06.830 --> 00:31:08.410
and famed first-rate swordsmen.

00:31:08.920 --> 00:31:10.460
Selling so many tokens at once

00:31:10.920 --> 00:31:12.500
will cause a huge mess.

00:31:13.160 --> 00:31:13.810
We'll

00:31:14.590 --> 00:31:15.410
easily be exposed too.

00:31:16.350 --> 00:31:17.020
And now,

00:31:17.400 --> 00:31:19.020
the top experts wanting tokens

00:31:19.680 --> 00:31:20.650
are fewer and fewer.

00:31:23.110 --> 00:31:23.780
Why?

00:31:25.350 --> 00:31:27.260
They think too many of them are coming,

00:31:27.880 --> 00:31:29.650
so many Wushuang City can't stop them.

00:31:30.030 --> 00:31:30.740
With this many,

00:31:31.200 --> 00:31:32.060
they could storm a city.

00:31:32.440 --> 00:31:33.540
Why need tokens at all?

00:31:35.590 --> 00:31:36.300
When the time comes,

00:31:36.550 --> 00:31:38.330
the chaos will only grow.

00:31:42.270 --> 00:31:42.890
Who's there?

00:31:46.000 --> 00:31:46.610
Me.

00:31:47.830 --> 00:31:48.570
Master!

00:31:56.030 --> 00:31:57.220
Keep your dirty dealings hidden.

00:31:57.790 --> 00:32:00.220
If you expose yourself in Wushuang City,

00:32:01.110 --> 00:32:02.700
I won't be able to keep you safe.
