00:00:05.920 --> 00:00:08.720
I know it’s rude to read someone else’s diary,

00:00:08.720 --> 00:00:10.960
but I think there are things you should know.

00:00:10.960 --> 00:00:12.960
I was both furious and disgusted.

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:16.320
I thought dying was the best way out.

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:18.760
I guess I started liking the sea more too.

00:00:18.760 --> 00:00:20.000
What is it?

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:21.640
Because it’s beautiful.

00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:24.080
The closer I look, the more I want to stay.

00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:26.680
I heard that tutor boy came back to school.

00:00:26.680 --> 00:00:28.040
Is he back?

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:29.040
Sometimes I really wonder

00:00:29.040 --> 00:00:30.240
what’s going on in your head.

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:31.720
When you talk to me, you say one thing.

00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:32.680
In the end,

00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:33.720
you’re just the kind of person

00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:35.320
who stands by and watches.

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:43.440
Professor about that question you gave earlier.

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:45.440
I still don’t quite get it.

00:00:47.080 --> 00:00:50.560
Well, if you’d like to understand it better,

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:53.600
you can come to my place

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:54.920
and I'll tutor you all night.

00:00:56.560 --> 00:00:59.160
So does this mean you have a private tutor class?

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:01.600
Yes,

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:03.600
it's a private class.

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:05.200
Many students have joined me

00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:07.120
in my one on one classes.

00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:04.200
It's only the beginning of the semester

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:06.000
and you're already looking for fresh meat?

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:07.120
Then I'll...

00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:09.280
Please excuse me, we'll talk later.

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:16.600
What are you doing?

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:19.040
Are you going to blackmail him, like me?

00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:22.320
Did I do that?

00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:25.240
Uh.. Why don't I remember that at all?

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:29.400
Do I need to remind you?

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:31.680
Do I need to remind you?!

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:33.240
How fucked up it was?!

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:34.720
How many students did you this to?!

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:36.560
Hey! What are you doing?

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:39.200
Ice!? You again?

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:41.720
Why do you keep bothering us?

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:44.200
It's not like I want to be involved

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:45.640
with this kind of person.

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:47.920
If you're not bothering us, then when was that?

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:49.720
If I hadn’t stopped you,

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:51.400
you probably would’ve punched him already, right?

00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:53.960
Forget about it, just ignore him.

00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:55.520
I can’t just ignore it.

00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:58.040
I think this kid has issues.

00:02:58.040 --> 00:03:00.000
He likes to destroy other people’s families.

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:03.000
I didn’t mean to hurt your family, Professor.

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:05.240
I just wanted to warn Professor Mint not to

00:03:05.240 --> 00:03:07.240
repeat his old habits with the new student.

00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:08.520
What habits?

00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:10.000
What more do you want from us?

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:12.360
You already made me lose my baby last time.

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:15.280
I didn’t make you miscarry, and you know that.

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:18.000
If you hadn’t interfered with my family,

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:20.000
my child wouldn’t have died!

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:22.800
I don’t understand why the university

00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:26.079
still gives someone like you another chance.

00:03:26.079 --> 00:03:28.040
Such a gentleman, huh?

00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:29.720
Letting a woman defend you.

00:03:29.960 --> 00:03:31.960
One day I’ll expose you.

00:03:31.960 --> 00:03:33.280
What are you doing!?

00:03:36.960 --> 00:03:38.280
Saint?

00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:39.800
What’s going on over there?

00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:42.520
Let’s go check.

00:03:42.520 --> 00:03:44.160
I’ll make sure you pay for this.

00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:45.360
Come with me to the dean’s office.

00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:45.960
I’m not going.

00:03:45.960 --> 00:03:46.600
Come with me!

00:03:46.600 --> 00:03:48.160
If I have to go, this bastard’s coming too!

00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:48.880
I said come with me!

00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:50.360
อาจารย์เหี้ยนี่แหละทำชีวิตผมพัง

00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:50.960
I said I’m not going!

00:03:50.960 --> 00:03:51.480
Come here, now!

00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:52.000
Ice!

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:52.560
Come here, now!

00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:53.320
You’re coming with me!

00:03:53.320 --> 00:03:54.360
Professor Fah, don’t!

00:03:54.360 --> 00:03:55.320
Professor Fah, please stop!

00:03:55.320 --> 00:03:56.200
Professor Fah..

00:03:56.920 --> 00:03:58.920
Fah!

00:04:01.760 --> 00:04:03.760
What’s going on here!?

00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:14.600
I won’t let this slide,

00:04:14.600 --> 00:04:15.920
this is the second time already.

00:04:16.600 --> 00:04:18.200
Why does the university still let a student

00:04:18.200 --> 00:04:20.000
with a record like this stay enrolled?

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:20.920
I don’t understand!

00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:23.520
Please, calm down,

00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:26.080
they both probably didn't mean to.

00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:30.360
Then answer this, Ice..

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:33.080
Why did you attack Professor Mint?

00:04:33.920 --> 00:04:35.920
What did he do to you?

00:04:38.240 --> 00:04:40.240
Uh, when we were in class,

00:04:40.960 --> 00:04:42.960
everything seemed normal.

00:04:43.480 --> 00:04:44.640
But after class,

00:04:44.920 --> 00:04:46.360
he got into an argument with Professor Mint

00:04:46.360 --> 00:04:47.240
and Professor Fah.

00:04:48.080 --> 00:04:51.200
Luckily Saint got there in time to stop it,

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:53.120
but it was probably too forceful

00:04:53.120 --> 00:04:54.560
and caused Professor Fah to fall.

00:04:58.600 --> 00:05:00.600
Then I’ll ask you again.

00:05:01.040 --> 00:05:02.560
Do you have anything to explain?

00:05:02.560 --> 00:05:04.640
Why did you attack Professor Mint?

00:05:12.640 --> 00:05:14.600
…No, I don’t.

00:05:16.480 --> 00:05:18.480
And you, Saint?

00:05:21.600 --> 00:05:22.800
No.

00:05:26.520 --> 00:05:27.760
So what should we do now?

00:05:28.320 --> 00:05:30.640
You still want this student to stay at the university?

00:05:31.520 --> 00:05:33.520
And what about my safety and Professor Mint’s?

00:05:34.520 --> 00:05:36.040
Who’s going to guarantee that?

00:05:36.520 --> 00:05:38.240
Please calm down, Professor Fah.

00:05:38.240 --> 00:05:40.240
The disciplinary committee

00:05:40.240 --> 00:05:41.960
already has procedures in place.

00:05:42.440 --> 00:05:44.280
But in this case,

00:05:44.280 --> 00:05:48.240
nothing meets the criteria for a severe punishment,

00:05:48.240 --> 00:05:50.520
like expulsion or anything like that.

00:05:51.280 --> 00:05:52.920
If we just wait,

00:05:53.280 --> 00:05:55.280
I'll probably be harassed every day.

00:05:57.240 --> 00:05:58.920
How about this?

00:05:59.120 --> 00:06:03.040
Maybe you should report this directly to the dean.

00:06:03.040 --> 00:06:07.440
He might have a better way to handle it.

00:06:11.240 --> 00:06:12.600
Professor Fah..

00:06:13.840 --> 00:06:17.440
I’m really sorry that you fell earlier.

00:06:18.880 --> 00:06:22.240
I want to take full responsibility for what I did.

00:06:25.680 --> 00:06:27.680
Please, don’t make this a big deal.

00:06:33.120 --> 00:06:34.040
Wait,

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:37.000
Saint.. Are you saying you’ll take disciplinary punishment?

00:06:38.440 --> 00:06:39.120
Yes.

00:06:39.680 --> 00:06:41.680
You do know that

00:06:42.200 --> 00:06:44.400
if you accept disciplinary punishment,

00:06:45.120 --> 00:06:47.120
no matter how good your grades are,

00:06:47.280 --> 00:06:48.400
you’ll lose eligibility

00:06:48.400 --> 00:06:50.400
for the Outstanding Student Award this year, right?

00:06:58.360 --> 00:07:00.000
Yes, I understand.

00:07:00.800 --> 00:07:02.960
Either way, this semester

00:07:02.960 --> 00:07:04.960
I’ll be looking after Ice.

00:07:05.840 --> 00:07:07.960
That way, Professor Fah, you can feel assured

00:07:07.960 --> 00:07:09.960
this won’t happen again.

00:07:15.080 --> 00:07:18.600
Let’s just end it here.

00:07:23.600 --> 00:07:24.720
Fine.

00:07:25.920 --> 00:07:27.920
But please,

00:07:27.920 --> 00:07:30.240
don’t let anything like this happen again.

00:07:51.520 --> 00:07:53.520
Then sign here.

00:08:01.960 --> 00:08:06.600
(Aditep… Student under disciplinary action)

00:08:07.440 --> 00:08:08.280
Mud,

00:08:09.360 --> 00:08:12.120
don’t leave yet. I need to talk to you.

00:08:13.200 --> 00:08:13.920
Yes.

00:08:32.600 --> 00:08:33.559
I’ll help you.

00:08:37.760 --> 00:08:39.159
Why would you help me?

00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:46.000
Because it’s my fault too that

00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:47.280
I bumped into Professor Fah.

00:08:48.080 --> 00:08:51.440
Let me help clean up with you.

00:08:58.880 --> 00:09:00.880
Can you stop getting involved with me?

00:09:04.280 --> 00:09:05.400
Why?

00:09:08.600 --> 00:09:10.200
Because I did wrong,

00:09:10.200 --> 00:09:11.440
and I have to take responsibility.

00:09:12.680 --> 00:09:15.920
And the more you hang around me,

00:09:15.920 --> 00:09:17.920
the worse it’ll be for you.

00:09:40.200 --> 00:09:41.040
Fine.

00:09:41.880 --> 00:09:44.400
If you really want to clean, then do it yourself.

00:09:45.600 --> 00:09:47.600
Hey, Ice, wait!

00:09:57.680 --> 00:09:58.960
I just want you to know,

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:02.000
whatever you’ve been through,

00:10:02.320 --> 00:10:04.560
from now on, if anything happens,

00:10:04.560 --> 00:10:07.400
you can tell me. I’ll help you.

00:10:10.640 --> 00:10:12.640
What could you possibly do to help me?

00:10:15.360 --> 00:10:17.680
Can you stop trying to come back into my life?

00:10:19.640 --> 00:10:20.880
It’s too late.

00:10:24.760 --> 00:10:25.800
Just let me go.

00:10:28.200 --> 00:10:31.080
I know now why you tried to kill yourself

00:10:33.360 --> 00:10:36.200
and about what happened between you and Professor Mint.

00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:41.000
But don’t be scared,

00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:44.000
you still have me by your side.

00:10:56.320 --> 00:10:57.600
How do you know?

00:11:02.480 --> 00:11:03.840
I read your diary.

00:11:11.280 --> 00:11:12.520
I believe you.

00:11:19.480 --> 00:11:21.120
Why did you do that?

00:11:25.080 --> 00:11:27.080
Why are you trying to get involved with me again?

00:11:30.320 --> 00:11:32.320
Please, let me help you, Ice.

00:11:37.760 --> 00:11:39.760
If you really want to help me,

00:11:43.080 --> 00:11:45.080
then stay out of my life.

00:12:39.520 --> 00:12:40.880
Hey, babe.

00:12:45.600 --> 00:12:46.280
Oh, hey.

00:12:46.480 --> 00:12:47.000
Hmm?

00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:48.160
I smell awful,

00:12:48.160 --> 00:12:49.880
I was just cleaning up trash.

00:12:50.440 --> 00:12:52.440
Why’d you do that?

00:13:00.400 --> 00:13:02.400
Volunteering at the university.

00:13:05.400 --> 00:13:07.160
Oh, new headphones?

00:13:07.960 --> 00:13:08.880
What happened to mine?

00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:12.000
My roommate broke them.

00:13:12.560 --> 00:13:13.440
Really?

00:13:13.440 --> 00:13:14.200
What happened?

00:13:15.520 --> 00:13:16.000
Hmm?

00:13:17.280 --> 00:13:18.600
It's nothing.

00:13:19.600 --> 00:13:21.960
Why aren’t you sleeping in your dorm tonight?

00:13:21.960 --> 00:13:23.000
Do you miss me or something?

00:13:25.080 --> 00:13:27.080
I’m just sick of my roommate.

00:13:27.760 --> 00:13:29.400
That roommate again!

00:13:29.400 --> 00:13:30.920
Want me to go deal with him for you, babe?

00:13:30.920 --> 00:13:31.880
No,

00:13:33.400 --> 00:13:34.920
it’s fine.

00:13:34.920 --> 00:13:36.280
It's ok.

00:13:37.240 --> 00:13:38.400
You sure?

00:13:39.240 --> 00:13:40.000
Yeah.

00:13:40.520 --> 00:13:42.520
So, how was class today?

00:13:42.600 --> 00:13:44.600
Anyone bothering you?

00:13:46.840 --> 00:13:48.520
No one, babe.

00:13:49.440 --> 00:13:53.440
Did you see Saint at school?

00:13:56.440 --> 00:13:59.200
How could I? We’re in different years.

00:14:00.480 --> 00:14:02.480
Good.

00:14:04.400 --> 00:14:06.400
You want to rest for a bit?

00:14:11.520 --> 00:14:14.120
Hey, where’s my guitar that was right there?

00:14:15.680 --> 00:14:18.480
Oh,

00:14:19.160 --> 00:14:21.560
I took it to my friend’s studio to record something,

00:14:21.560 --> 00:14:23.560
but I think I left it there.

00:14:24.040 --> 00:14:25.280
Yeah…

00:14:26.160 --> 00:14:28.080
But babe,

00:14:28.080 --> 00:14:30.640
can I borrow your guitar for my tour?

00:14:34.320 --> 00:14:36.320
For this concert?

00:14:38.560 --> 00:14:40.000
Please?

00:14:42.320 --> 00:14:44.920
You should’ve asked first, don’t you think?

00:14:44.920 --> 00:14:46.920
Come on, babe,

00:14:46.920 --> 00:14:50.320
you weren’t even using it.

00:14:50.320 --> 00:14:51.920
I didn’t want it to rust,

00:14:51.920 --> 00:14:54.960
so I used it to keep it in good shape.

00:14:54.960 --> 00:14:58.520
And now I’m attached to it, it feels so good to play.

00:15:03.160 --> 00:15:04.360
Please, babe,

00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:07.000
if I play your song on stage,

00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:09.360
I’ll tell everyone that

00:15:09.360 --> 00:15:11.440
it’s a song my boyfriend wrote for me.

00:15:11.440 --> 00:15:13.080
How’s that sound?

00:15:16.040 --> 00:15:17.200
I Promise.

00:15:18.840 --> 00:15:20.000
Okay?

00:15:20.960 --> 00:15:22.000
I promise.

00:15:22.400 --> 00:15:23.200
Promise?

00:15:23.480 --> 00:15:24.640
Hmm?

00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:29.000
I Promise,

00:15:30.360 --> 00:15:31.640
Ice.

00:15:33.520 --> 00:15:35.520
Hmm?

00:15:44.040 --> 00:15:46.400
You’re the cutest.

00:15:47.240 --> 00:15:49.240
Who do you belong to, huh?

00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:30.920
Babe,

00:16:31.720 --> 00:16:33.720
we’ve been together for a while now.

00:16:34.120 --> 00:16:38.120
Can’t we kiss like other couples do?

00:16:39.600 --> 00:16:43.040
My friend’s been dating this person for one day,

00:16:43.040 --> 00:16:45.040
and they’ve already done way more than just kiss.

00:16:48.160 --> 00:16:50.160
Warm…

00:16:50.880 --> 00:16:52.000
I smell so bad,

00:16:52.800 --> 00:16:54.960
I need a shower first.

00:16:54.960 --> 00:16:55.640
Huh?

00:16:55.640 --> 00:16:58.080
I’m all sweaty, Warm.

00:16:58.080 --> 00:16:59.800
I’ll be quick.

00:16:59.800 --> 00:17:00.680
Really?

00:17:01.880 --> 00:17:04.560
Ice, uh....

00:17:06.720 --> 00:17:08.720
Oh, shit!

00:17:38.040 --> 00:17:38.760
Hey,

00:17:39.120 --> 00:17:40.560
Pas's father came to be

00:17:40.560 --> 00:17:42.120
the music therapist teacher today.

00:17:42.120 --> 00:17:44.360
Wanna check the class out?

00:17:46.920 --> 00:17:47.760
No,

00:17:48.320 --> 00:17:49.280
you go ahead.

00:17:49.600 --> 00:17:51.600
I’ll just wait here.

00:17:54.480 --> 00:17:57.320
But I think you look a little down today.

00:17:57.920 --> 00:17:59.920
Maybe try something new?

00:18:00.360 --> 00:18:02.360
It looks fun,

00:18:02.560 --> 00:18:04.560
I think it’d help.

00:18:05.440 --> 00:18:07.680
Book’s going too.

00:18:08.680 --> 00:18:10.680
Yeah, let’s go.

00:18:11.480 --> 00:18:12.240
Come on,

00:18:12.240 --> 00:18:13.360
let’s go heal our hearts.

00:18:16.120 --> 00:18:17.120
Okay, let’s go.

00:18:18.480 --> 00:18:20.480
Alright, everyone, welcome.

00:18:22.600 --> 00:18:24.600
Hello.

00:18:24.600 --> 00:18:25.120
Hi.

00:18:25.120 --> 00:18:25.920
Hello.

00:18:25.920 --> 00:18:28.480
So for today’s therapy class,

00:18:28.480 --> 00:18:32.440
the goal isn’t just to play instruments,

00:18:32.440 --> 00:18:36.200
music helps us feel

00:18:36.200 --> 00:18:40.320
and connect with what’s inside of us.

00:18:40.320 --> 00:18:41.320
Alright,

00:18:41.320 --> 00:18:46.280
let’s find an instrument you’re drawn to,

00:18:46.280 --> 00:18:48.360
or you can just listen to the sounds first.

00:18:48.360 --> 00:18:50.640
Go ahead, try it out.

00:19:01.720 --> 00:19:05.800
We’ll start with a simple question today:

00:19:05.800 --> 00:19:08.800
Who do you miss the most right now?

00:19:09.880 --> 00:19:12.520
And how are you connected to them?

00:19:22.720 --> 00:19:25.040
Sometimes the smallest sound

00:19:25.040 --> 00:19:28.480
is actually the loudest one in our hearts.

00:19:32.720 --> 00:19:35.320
So, how do you feel, Ni?

00:19:38.120 --> 00:19:40.120
I’m… not sure.

00:19:42.880 --> 00:19:43.720
That’s okay,

00:19:43.720 --> 00:19:47.040
try playing and listen to what it tells you.

00:20:27.240 --> 00:20:29.240
But he knows right...?

00:21:04.360 --> 00:21:06.360
Did you really write this song yourself?

00:21:07.720 --> 00:21:08.600
Yeah.

00:21:09.840 --> 00:21:12.040
But it’s not finished yet.

00:21:12.640 --> 00:21:17.520
Even unfinished, it’s beautiful.

00:21:18.440 --> 00:21:20.680
You can write something this sweet,

00:21:20.680 --> 00:21:24.640
you must’ve been in love before, right?

00:21:30.680 --> 00:21:32.680
Actually, no.

00:21:35.040 --> 00:21:35.800
Really?

00:21:36.400 --> 00:21:39.760
Have you ever had a crush on anyone?

00:21:43.000 --> 00:21:43.880
Well…

00:21:45.160 --> 00:21:49.520
I’ve only been focused on work and school.

00:21:52.200 --> 00:21:53.520
Good, that’s good.

00:21:55.200 --> 00:21:56.240
And what about you?

00:21:56.680 --> 00:21:58.680
You like someone?

00:22:16.600 --> 00:22:18.760
Hmm… by the way,

00:22:20.000 --> 00:22:21.200
this guitar must’ve

00:22:21.200 --> 00:22:23.120
been with you for a long time, right?

00:22:29.720 --> 00:22:30.400
Yeah,

00:22:31.440 --> 00:22:33.080
it was my mom’s.

00:22:35.000 --> 00:22:39.000
She used to be really good at guitar.

00:22:46.360 --> 00:22:48.360
If we don’t get to see each other again…

00:22:49.720 --> 00:22:53.320
can I fix your guitar for you?

00:22:53.840 --> 00:22:54.920
Fix it?

00:23:33.160 --> 00:23:38.640
(Is it still me that you love?)

00:23:38.640 --> 00:23:45.080
(Can it still be me that you miss?)

00:23:45.080 --> 00:23:50.280
(Because my broken heart still waits for your return.)

00:23:50.280 --> 00:23:56.760
(Just like when we were in love, I want to ask,)

00:23:56.760 --> 00:24:02.720
(can it still be me that you love?)

00:24:02.720 --> 00:24:09.080
(I still hold on to every promise,)

00:24:09.080 --> 00:24:12.880
(my heart wants to hold you like yesterday.)

00:24:12.880 --> 00:24:16.360
(Change these cold nights )

00:24:16.360 --> 00:24:20.840
(and bring us back to where we belong.)

00:24:20.840 --> 00:24:24.760
(That's all I want to ask.)

00:24:27.360 --> 00:24:28.760
Thank you.

00:24:29.520 --> 00:24:30.200
Thank you.

00:24:30.200 --> 00:24:31.560
That was so good.

00:24:31.560 --> 00:24:32.320
Thank you.

00:24:50.000 --> 00:24:52.000
How'd you get here?

00:24:52.280 --> 00:24:53.600
Won't your dad get mad?

00:24:53.600 --> 00:24:55.120
I'll just be here for a while

00:24:55.120 --> 00:24:57.120
and then I'll head back to study.

00:24:57.520 --> 00:24:58.480
Ah.

00:25:24.360 --> 00:25:25.640
Hurrr.

00:25:26.880 --> 00:25:28.880
It's fine.

00:25:45.920 --> 00:25:47.400
I'm all out.

00:25:49.080 --> 00:25:50.280
One more.

00:25:53.280 --> 00:25:54.800
But this time I'll help.

00:25:58.680 --> 00:26:00.880
Just help me look.

00:26:00.880 --> 00:26:02.320
Wait.

00:26:09.760 --> 00:26:11.000
Huh? Is it straight?

00:26:11.360 --> 00:26:12.680
It's straight.

00:26:12.680 --> 00:26:13.280
Well?

00:26:13.280 --> 00:26:13.800
Ok,

00:26:14.720 --> 00:26:16.720
let's start.

00:26:21.200 --> 00:26:22.040
Yes!

00:26:54.720 --> 00:26:57.040
Here, this is for you.

00:26:58.920 --> 00:27:00.920
Really?

00:27:11.560 --> 00:27:12.800
Thank you.

00:27:15.600 --> 00:27:18.280
Will we ever meet again?

00:27:20.920 --> 00:27:22.240
Of course,

00:27:22.240 --> 00:27:24.240
because I’m going to enter university with you.

00:27:28.120 --> 00:27:29.360
Is it cute?

00:27:30.160 --> 00:27:32.160
Yes.

00:27:42.640 --> 00:27:43.880
Let me see.

00:27:44.720 --> 00:27:46.120
That one’s fine too.

00:27:59.600 --> 00:28:01.560
If you’ve found the instrument that

00:28:01.560 --> 00:28:02.800
feels right to you,

00:28:02.800 --> 00:28:04.600
then think about

00:28:04.600 --> 00:28:07.400
the person you’re missing or thinking of.

00:28:08.720 --> 00:28:11.840
What do you still hold onto with them?

00:28:12.360 --> 00:28:15.960
Then slowly play and let the music flow.

00:28:29.200 --> 00:28:31.200
Dad, why are you doing this?

00:28:32.520 --> 00:28:36.440
Go change, you’re meeting with Lanee’s family.

00:28:36.840 --> 00:28:38.840
Don’t make me repeat myself.

00:28:40.000 --> 00:28:41.520
I don’t like Lanee.

00:28:41.520 --> 00:28:42.720
She’s my friend.

00:28:43.680 --> 00:28:45.680
I’m going to celebrate with Ice.

00:28:48.640 --> 00:28:50.320
Go change

00:28:50.320 --> 00:28:51.920
and come downstairs!

00:30:08.120 --> 00:30:10.880
Now, imagine that

00:30:10.880 --> 00:30:13.160
you’ve met the person you’re thinking of.

00:30:13.160 --> 00:30:15.160
How would you feel?

00:30:15.760 --> 00:30:17.920
Happy, sad,

00:30:18.800 --> 00:30:21.560
relieved, or in pain?

00:30:29.760 --> 00:30:32.600
Let yourself enter that memory slowly.

00:30:34.240 --> 00:30:35.440
Let go!

00:30:37.640 --> 00:30:39.640
You think I’m stupid?

00:30:40.240 --> 00:30:41.800
You’re still planning to see him?

00:30:42.680 --> 00:30:44.680
I’ve already told the school to suspend him.

00:30:45.400 --> 00:30:46.920
Stop seeing him,

00:30:47.280 --> 00:30:49.280
think about your father for once.

00:30:50.280 --> 00:30:52.280
Why are you doing this, Dad?

00:31:03.880 --> 00:31:04.760
Dad!

00:31:07.320 --> 00:31:08.280
Dad!

00:31:09.000 --> 00:31:10.000
Dad!

00:31:11.120 --> 00:31:12.080
Dad!

00:31:12.960 --> 00:31:14.960
Let me go!

00:31:15.240 --> 00:31:17.280
Give me back my phone!

00:31:17.280 --> 00:31:20.440
If you don’t stop obsessing over that tutor,

00:31:20.440 --> 00:31:22.160
don’t ever expect to be let out.

00:31:22.160 --> 00:31:23.440
Dad!

00:31:23.760 --> 00:31:25.760
Dad, please don’t do this.

00:31:26.840 --> 00:31:28.240
Dad!

00:31:29.080 --> 00:31:30.720
Keep a close eye on him!

00:31:30.720 --> 00:31:32.400
If he keeps acting crazy,

00:31:32.400 --> 00:31:35.480
lock him up and don’t let him leave.

00:31:57.480 --> 00:32:00.480
Then think about what you’d like to tell that person,

00:32:00.480 --> 00:32:02.760
something you want them to know.

00:32:05.480 --> 00:32:08.040
Try expressing it through the instrument.

00:32:23.040 --> 00:32:25.280
You’re lucky we got to you in time.

00:32:25.640 --> 00:32:26.880
When you arrived,

00:32:26.880 --> 00:32:28.920
we had to pump your stomach immediately.

00:32:28.920 --> 00:32:32.080
You may feel tired

00:32:32.080 --> 00:32:34.040
or nauseous afterward, that’s normal.

00:32:34.040 --> 00:32:35.880
You don’t have to hurt yourself anymore.

00:32:35.880 --> 00:32:37.520
You’re safe now.

00:32:37.520 --> 00:32:39.480
The police have already deleted all the videos.

00:32:39.480 --> 00:32:43.640
We’ve detained the people who forced you to do it.

00:32:43.640 --> 00:32:45.720
If anything happens again,

00:32:45.720 --> 00:32:47.800
report it to the police right away.

00:32:49.360 --> 00:32:50.560
Thank you.

00:32:51.840 --> 00:32:53.200
Thank you, officer.

00:32:53.440 --> 00:32:54.800
Get plenty of rest, alright?

00:32:54.800 --> 00:32:55.960
Okay.

00:32:55.960 --> 00:32:58.000
Thank you, doctor.

00:33:08.440 --> 00:33:10.320
Thank you for all the information.

00:33:11.120 --> 00:33:11.920
Yes.

00:33:11.920 --> 00:33:13.760
If it weren’t for you, things could’ve ended badly.

00:33:13.760 --> 00:33:15.040
Thank you.

00:33:31.960 --> 00:33:34.360
I’m sorry, Sea.

00:33:37.680 --> 00:33:39.200
It’s alright, everything will get better.

00:33:40.520 --> 00:33:41.880
Get some rest.

00:34:22.000 --> 00:34:24.000
Excuse me, I’m going to the bathroom.

00:34:33.400 --> 00:34:35.400
Keep playing, everyone.

00:34:36.360 --> 00:34:38.360
What the hell is wrong with Ice?

00:34:39.080 --> 00:34:40.840
Because of him, I got called in by the professor

00:34:40.840 --> 00:34:42.360
even though I didn’t do anything.

00:34:42.360 --> 00:34:44.760
And he got Saint punished too.

00:34:44.760 --> 00:34:47.080
And Professor Sara only made him pick up trash?

00:34:47.800 --> 00:34:49.800
What a joke! Totally unfair.

00:34:50.040 --> 00:34:51.239
I feel like paying him back.

00:34:51.960 --> 00:34:52.560
Mud,

00:34:53.280 --> 00:34:54.760
what are you gonna do to Ice now?

00:34:57.320 --> 00:34:58.920
Don’t know yet.

00:34:59.680 --> 00:35:01.280
But he’s gonna get what’s coming to him.

00:35:01.880 --> 00:35:04.280
Trash like him still gets to study here?

00:35:04.280 --> 00:35:06.280
Why do you hate him so much?

00:35:06.760 --> 00:35:08.080
I don’t hate him,

00:35:08.680 --> 00:35:10.680
I just want to make our society better.

00:35:13.880 --> 00:35:14.720
Mud,

00:35:15.200 --> 00:35:16.840
calm down, man.

00:35:17.280 --> 00:35:20.400
If someone never had a problem with you before,

00:35:20.400 --> 00:35:22.400
why would they start one out of nowhere?

00:35:22.400 --> 00:35:24.080
Ever think maybe Professor Mint

00:35:24.080 --> 00:35:25.960
did something to him first?

00:35:27.480 --> 00:35:28.640
I don’t know.

00:35:29.520 --> 00:35:31.200
But he hurt my friend,

00:35:31.200 --> 00:35:32.600
so I’m gonna make him pay.

00:35:35.080 --> 00:35:39.160
Whatever, don't say I didn't warn you.

00:35:39.160 --> 00:35:41.160
You’ll see soon enough.

00:35:45.040 --> 00:35:47.280
You never stop whining, Book.

00:35:47.280 --> 00:35:48.760
So annoying.

00:35:57.440 --> 00:35:58.800
Hey, Ten!

00:36:00.120 --> 00:36:01.880
I’ve got the perfect plan for revenge.

00:36:03.400 --> 00:36:05.400
What do you want me to do now, Mud?

00:36:14.040 --> 00:36:15.160
What the hell are you staring at?

00:36:15.160 --> 00:36:15.760
Hey!

00:36:16.320 --> 00:36:18.320
What are you looking at?

00:36:21.240 --> 00:36:22.520
Go, go.

00:36:24.640 --> 00:36:25.680
Which room?

00:36:26.080 --> 00:36:28.080
Hold on.

00:36:32.440 --> 00:36:33.320
Which room?

00:36:35.880 --> 00:36:37.000
This one.

00:36:38.560 --> 00:36:39.760
Hurry up.

00:36:43.120 --> 00:36:44.600
I’ll do the writing myself.

00:36:44.600 --> 00:36:46.400
Yeah, just hurry up.

00:36:47.760 --> 00:36:49.000
Hold it still, dude.

00:36:52.840 --> 00:36:54.240
(TRASH)

00:36:54.640 --> 00:36:56.640
I’ll make sure everyone sees this clearly.

00:36:57.200 --> 00:37:00.000
If he reads this, man, I’ll cry tears of joy.

00:37:00.000 --> 00:37:00.800
(EVIL)

00:37:06.280 --> 00:37:07.320
Damn, it’s hot as hell.

00:37:07.320 --> 00:37:07.840
What?

00:37:07.840 --> 00:37:08.800
Why are you taking that off?

00:37:08.800 --> 00:37:10.080
It’s hot.

00:37:10.080 --> 00:37:12.720
Then why’d you make me wear this?

00:37:12.920 --> 00:37:14.080
Here, we’re done.

00:37:14.080 --> 00:37:14.560
Hey.

00:37:14.840 --> 00:37:15.920
Dude, someone’s coming.

00:37:15.920 --> 00:37:16.760
Is it Ice? I don’t know.

00:37:16.760 --> 00:37:17.280
What is that?

00:37:17.280 --> 00:37:18.240
Go, go.

00:37:18.240 --> 00:37:19.880
Put the hat on.

00:37:19.880 --> 00:37:21.880
Just go, forget it. Ten, you idiot.

00:37:34.320 --> 00:37:38.000
(EVIL TRASH)

00:38:05.560 --> 00:38:07.560
Alright, safe and sound.

00:38:09.920 --> 00:38:11.920
Okay, bye-bye, see you.

00:38:13.640 --> 00:38:15.640
Ice, what are you doing, dear?

00:38:16.640 --> 00:38:17.560
Ice?

00:38:18.160 --> 00:38:19.080
Huh!?

00:38:20.360 --> 00:38:22.360
Who did this?

00:38:25.160 --> 00:38:26.720
What happened?

00:38:27.680 --> 00:38:29.280
If the landlord sees this,

00:38:29.280 --> 00:38:30.520
they’re gonna kill me.

00:38:31.040 --> 00:38:33.040
Are you okay?

00:38:36.000 --> 00:38:38.000
There! Saint!

00:38:38.000 --> 00:38:39.560
Hurry,

00:38:39.560 --> 00:38:40.240
come here!

00:38:40.240 --> 00:38:41.480
Something happened!

00:38:42.360 --> 00:38:43.120
What happened?

00:38:43.120 --> 00:38:43.920
Here.

00:38:45.040 --> 00:38:46.160
See for yourself.

00:38:46.640 --> 00:38:48.440
(EVIL TRASH)

00:38:52.000 --> 00:38:53.840
If the owner asks for compensation,

00:38:53.840 --> 00:38:54.800
I’ll pay.

00:38:59.200 --> 00:39:02.040
It’s fine, I’ll handle it.

00:39:03.320 --> 00:39:04.280
I’m really sorry.

00:39:04.280 --> 00:39:07.960
I have to apologize to Ice and Saint for what happened.

00:39:07.960 --> 00:39:10.520
I’ll tighten the building’s security.

00:39:10.520 --> 00:39:13.440
From now on, outsiders won’t be allowed in at all.

00:39:13.440 --> 00:39:16.160
But right now, I’ll go check the CCTV footage.

00:39:16.160 --> 00:39:18.000
There are two camera angles.

00:39:18.000 --> 00:39:18.760
Give me a second,

00:39:18.760 --> 00:39:20.240
I’ll be right back.

00:39:20.240 --> 00:39:21.160
Stay calm, everyone!

00:39:21.160 --> 00:39:22.800
Stay calm! I’ll be right back.

00:39:27.480 --> 00:39:29.280
You okay?

00:39:29.280 --> 00:39:30.000
Are you hurt?

00:39:31.320 --> 00:39:33.320
I’m fine, move.

00:39:40.960 --> 00:39:42.520
(TRASH)

00:39:42.520 --> 00:39:43.160
Ice.

00:39:43.560 --> 00:39:44.440
Ice.

00:39:45.440 --> 00:39:46.320
Hey.

00:39:49.400 --> 00:39:50.240
Ice.

00:39:51.000 --> 00:39:51.960
Wait.

00:39:52.280 --> 00:39:52.800
Hey.

00:39:53.640 --> 00:39:54.840
Don’t worry about the door.

00:39:54.840 --> 00:39:56.640
I’ll buy paint and fix it myself.

00:39:59.040 --> 00:40:01.040
You can kick me out if you want.

00:40:02.560 --> 00:40:03.840
Why would I?

00:40:04.320 --> 00:40:05.400
You didn’t do anything wrong.

00:40:05.800 --> 00:40:07.800
The one who wrote on the wall is the one at fault.

00:40:09.320 --> 00:40:11.320
If it weren’t for me,

00:40:11.320 --> 00:40:13.520
you wouldn’t have to deal with this crap.

00:40:15.280 --> 00:40:16.320
No,

00:40:16.920 --> 00:40:18.480
this isn’t your fault.

00:40:19.000 --> 00:40:21.840
I’ll go talk to Meena and find out who did it.

00:40:22.480 --> 00:40:23.400
Forget it.

00:40:24.560 --> 00:40:26.560
It’s easier if I just move out.

00:40:27.400 --> 00:40:30.000
You’re not going anywhere.

00:40:30.320 --> 00:40:31.760
Get some rest. I’ll clean it up.

00:40:31.760 --> 00:40:33.920
Hey.

00:40:33.920 --> 00:40:35.920
I said I’ll clean it.

00:40:36.360 --> 00:40:37.920
Can you stop being nice to me for once?

00:40:38.840 --> 00:40:40.000
Just be mad at me!

00:40:40.000 --> 00:40:40.960
Yell at me!

00:40:41.920 --> 00:40:43.440
I caused you all this trouble,

00:40:44.600 --> 00:40:46.080
and you’re still being nice?

00:40:46.640 --> 00:40:48.640
Why are you still helping me?

00:41:11.200 --> 00:41:12.840
Hello, this is Pas.

00:41:12.840 --> 00:41:14.720
Are you close to Or's restuarant yet?

00:41:17.240 --> 00:41:18.680
I'm almost there.

00:41:19.640 --> 00:41:21.280
I’ll head over soon.

00:41:22.360 --> 00:41:23.720
Just a bit.

00:41:37.520 --> 00:41:39.520
I’ll finish cleaning later.

00:42:14.200 --> 00:42:19.800
(It’s because of me, the way I am.)

00:42:19.800 --> 00:42:28.160
(I made you disappointed, I made you hurt.)

00:42:28.160 --> 00:42:33.680
(Aren’t you tired of someone like me?)

00:42:33.680 --> 00:42:42.760
(All I do is make you cry.)

00:42:42.760 --> 00:42:45.520
(No matter how much I love you,)

00:42:45.520 --> 00:42:49.920
(I still let you down.)

00:42:49.920 --> 00:42:52.680
(Believe me, it hurts me too,)

00:42:52.680 --> 00:42:55.240
(the things I’ve done.)

00:42:55.240 --> 00:43:02.400
(I’m so sorry, this is all I can do.)

00:43:02.400 --> 00:43:06.520
(Even though I love you so much,)

00:43:06.520 --> 00:43:10.360
(I still end up hurting you.)

00:43:10.360 --> 00:43:16.720
(Sorry that I’m like this.)

00:43:16.720 --> 00:43:20.480
(I’d do anything if you could forgive me.)

00:43:20.480 --> 00:43:27.800
(I never meant to hurt you.)

00:43:43.080 --> 00:43:44.680
Woohoo!

00:43:44.680 --> 00:43:46.880
That was beautiful!

00:43:46.880 --> 00:43:48.200
So cute!

00:43:48.200 --> 00:43:50.160
You sang so well!

00:43:51.040 --> 00:43:52.840
Thank you so much, everyone.

00:43:52.840 --> 00:43:55.000
Hope to see you again soon.

00:43:55.000 --> 00:43:58.000
Woohoo!

00:43:58.000 --> 00:44:00.000
Thank you!

00:44:05.400 --> 00:44:06.440
That part just now was great.

00:44:06.440 --> 00:44:07.880
I’m heading out, see you.

00:44:09.360 --> 00:44:10.000
Ice,

00:44:10.400 --> 00:44:12.800
you played so well tonight.

00:44:12.800 --> 00:44:16.160
Guess I’ll have to come drum for you more often.

00:44:16.160 --> 00:44:17.720
Not really.

00:44:17.720 --> 00:44:20.560
I still have a lot to improve.

00:44:20.560 --> 00:44:22.960
Come on, they were screaming for you.

00:44:24.080 --> 00:44:24.720
Thank you.

00:44:24.720 --> 00:44:26.640
Ice!

00:44:26.640 --> 00:44:28.040
Hi. Hi! Hi!

00:44:28.040 --> 00:44:31.600
The customers loved your performance!

00:44:31.600 --> 00:44:35.080
You passed the audition.

00:44:35.080 --> 00:44:39.680
So, can you play here every night?

00:44:40.040 --> 00:44:41.000
Yes.

00:44:41.440 --> 00:44:42.520
Thank you.

00:44:42.520 --> 00:44:45.000
We’ll talk about the schedule later.

00:44:45.000 --> 00:44:45.480
Sure.

00:44:45.480 --> 00:44:47.880
Okay, great!

00:44:47.880 --> 00:44:49.280
You were amazing. Hey, congrats, man!

00:44:49.280 --> 00:44:50.760
The kid’s got talent, I’m telling you.

00:44:50.760 --> 00:44:51.640
Yeah.

00:44:52.080 --> 00:44:54.080
Place is packed tonight.

00:44:56.640 --> 00:44:58.640
Good table spots too.

00:45:00.760 --> 00:45:02.760
That corner’s not bad either.

00:45:10.000 --> 00:45:11.760
Hey, you guys go grab seats first.

00:45:11.760 --> 00:45:12.640
I’ll be right there.

00:45:18.840 --> 00:45:21.920
If that’s all.

00:45:21.920 --> 00:45:23.920
I’ll head home now.

00:45:23.920 --> 00:45:25.440
Sure, sure. Go ahead.

00:45:25.440 --> 00:45:26.160
See you later.

00:45:26.160 --> 00:45:27.480
Get home safe. He’s in a rush, huh?

00:45:27.480 --> 00:45:29.480
Okay, bye!

00:45:30.400 --> 00:45:32.400
Was gonna ask him to eat with us.

00:45:46.120 --> 00:45:47.040
Zoom,

00:45:48.880 --> 00:45:50.440
what are you doing around here?

00:45:50.920 --> 00:45:51.600
Oh,

00:45:51.840 --> 00:45:52.720
I came to drink beer

00:45:53.120 --> 00:45:54.320
but I’m heading home soon.

00:45:54.600 --> 00:45:55.360
Hey,

00:45:55.640 --> 00:45:57.640
is Professor Mint telling you to go see him?

00:45:58.120 --> 00:45:59.640
If he is, then so what?

00:46:00.800 --> 00:46:03.240
So you’re still with him?

00:46:03.720 --> 00:46:06.200
Even though you know how shitty he is.

00:46:06.200 --> 00:46:08.000
What do you want me to do about it?

00:46:08.000 --> 00:46:09.600
Expose him?

00:46:11.600 --> 00:46:13.880
If Professor Mint gets exposed,

00:46:13.880 --> 00:46:16.520
no one else will be his victim anymore, right?

00:46:18.160 --> 00:46:20.160
I don’t want a life like yours.

00:46:20.160 --> 00:46:22.200
I don’t want a leaked video.

00:46:22.200 --> 00:46:24.960
One more term and I graduate.

00:46:25.840 --> 00:46:27.280
If this blows up,

00:46:28.120 --> 00:46:30.120
my future’s ruined like yours.

00:46:32.040 --> 00:46:34.040
So you choose to stay with him, huh.

00:46:34.440 --> 00:46:35.040
Yeah,

00:46:35.520 --> 00:46:38.120
if I help film and I survive,

00:46:38.840 --> 00:46:40.000
I’ll stay.

00:46:41.160 --> 00:46:42.000
Zoom,

00:46:42.240 --> 00:46:42.960
listen to me.

00:46:42.960 --> 00:46:46.040
You know what happens

00:46:46.040 --> 00:46:48.800
when you mess with Professor Mint.

00:46:50.080 --> 00:46:52.920
Our lives are kinda similar.

00:46:54.000 --> 00:46:57.920
Our moms left, there's so much debt,

00:46:57.920 --> 00:47:00.920
but I still have a dad to take care of,

00:47:00.920 --> 00:47:02.920
not like you.

00:47:03.760 --> 00:47:05.760
Just let me graduate quietly, please.

00:47:07.280 --> 00:47:08.840
I beg you.

00:47:32.480 --> 00:47:34.480
So what’s the plan, Ten?

00:47:35.440 --> 00:47:37.000
I think we need proof.

00:47:42.000 --> 00:47:44.680
Either Professor Mint... or Professor Mint?

00:47:44.680 --> 00:47:46.680
Fuck.

00:47:50.720 --> 00:47:54.960
I can’t take it anymore.

00:47:55.400 --> 00:47:57.000
But the live music’s really good.

00:47:57.000 --> 00:47:58.160
Yeah. Live music’s great.

00:47:58.160 --> 00:48:00.000
You gotta come here more often.

00:48:00.000 --> 00:48:02.240
The music’s awesome. Yeah.

00:48:02.560 --> 00:48:03.040
Hey Sea,

00:48:03.040 --> 00:48:04.400
I’m heading to the bathroom real quick.

00:48:04.400 --> 00:48:05.040
Ah, okay.

00:48:05.040 --> 00:48:06.640
I think my stomach’s upset, can’t handle it.

00:48:06.640 --> 00:48:08.080
You drank a lot, huh.

00:48:08.080 --> 00:48:09.960
Yeah, I can’t. Alright.

00:48:13.560 --> 00:48:15.560
Ice?

00:48:21.080 --> 00:48:21.960
Hey.

00:48:23.560 --> 00:48:24.560
Ice.

00:48:24.960 --> 00:48:25.640
Huh?

00:48:26.040 --> 00:48:27.320
Ice. Huh?

00:48:27.840 --> 00:48:29.760
Get up, why are you lying here like this?

00:48:29.760 --> 00:48:31.400
No, I don’t want to.

00:48:31.400 --> 00:48:32.320
Get up.

00:48:32.320 --> 00:48:33.040
Hm?

00:48:33.040 --> 00:48:33.560
Get up now.

00:48:33.560 --> 00:48:35.400
Get up. What the hell.

00:48:36.960 --> 00:48:38.960
Why are you sleeping here?

00:48:40.600 --> 00:48:41.440
Hey!

00:48:42.080 --> 00:48:43.080
Let go,

00:48:43.920 --> 00:48:45.040
you can't have this.

00:48:45.920 --> 00:48:48.080
I’ll drink it myself. Hey.

00:48:48.080 --> 00:48:50.080
Hey, that’s mine.

00:48:51.120 --> 00:48:53.640
Hey, that’s mine.

00:48:55.400 --> 00:48:58.400
Not okay.

00:48:58.400 --> 00:49:00.400
What’s not okay?

00:49:04.040 --> 00:49:05.440
What's wrong?

00:49:07.160 --> 00:49:08.400
What happened?

00:49:09.560 --> 00:49:10.800
Want to tell me?

00:49:15.800 --> 00:49:18.680
I hate myself so much.

00:49:18.680 --> 00:49:21.600
Why do I always bring bad luck to him?

00:49:26.080 --> 00:49:27.320
Who are you talking about?

00:49:29.000 --> 00:49:30.320
Saint?

00:49:32.560 --> 00:49:33.680
Yeah,

00:49:35.840 --> 00:49:37.840
but whatever,

00:49:38.560 --> 00:49:40.920
it’s not the same anymore.

00:49:42.880 --> 00:49:44.200
Calm down.

00:49:44.920 --> 00:49:46.920
Saint actually cares about you, man.

00:49:47.480 --> 00:49:49.480
Why don’t I feel it at all?

00:49:51.000 --> 00:49:53.400
He really does care.

00:49:53.400 --> 00:49:54.200
Hey.

00:49:55.800 --> 00:50:00.000
Ice. I don’t feel anything.

00:50:00.680 --> 00:50:02.080
Ice.

00:50:02.080 --> 00:50:03.120
Hm?

00:50:03.560 --> 00:50:04.480
Ice.

00:50:04.480 --> 00:50:07.280
I don't believe it.

00:50:08.360 --> 00:50:10.360
I just talked to you, are you asleep already?

00:50:10.360 --> 00:50:13.080
I don’t feel anything.

00:50:13.080 --> 00:50:14.480
Ice.

00:50:15.640 --> 00:50:18.480
Ice. Hm?

00:50:27.440 --> 00:50:28.600
Ice.

00:50:40.240 --> 00:50:42.240
Hello, Sea?

00:50:42.240 --> 00:50:43.160
Yeah, hello.

00:50:43.800 --> 00:50:46.200
Saint, can you help me carry Ice?

00:50:46.200 --> 00:50:47.680
He’s passed out drunk.

00:50:48.560 --> 00:50:50.880
Yes, yes, I will.

00:51:09.040 --> 00:51:10.000
Hey.

00:51:10.000 --> 00:51:10.880
Hurry up.

00:51:12.520 --> 00:51:13.840
Ice. Quick.

00:51:18.840 --> 00:51:20.760
Go back to your room and sleep.

00:51:20.760 --> 00:51:22.120
Come on. Hey.

00:51:22.120 --> 00:51:22.920
Come here.

00:51:22.920 --> 00:51:25.240
I’ll sleep wherever I want.

00:51:25.240 --> 00:51:25.920
Go.

00:51:27.280 --> 00:51:31.000
I don’t want to go back.

00:51:31.000 --> 00:51:32.760
Ice. Walk properly, Ice.

00:51:32.760 --> 00:51:35.360
I’m not going back.

00:51:35.360 --> 00:51:36.520
Not going back!

00:51:36.520 --> 00:51:37.520
Go back!

00:51:37.520 --> 00:51:39.160
Not going back!

00:51:39.160 --> 00:51:40.640
Come in.

00:51:40.640 --> 00:51:41.480
Not going back!

00:51:41.480 --> 00:51:42.640
Come in.

00:51:42.640 --> 00:51:43.840
Watch his head.

00:51:46.520 --> 00:51:47.800
Not okay.

00:51:49.560 --> 00:51:50.880
Not okay at all.

00:51:53.880 --> 00:51:55.480
Hey, take him back in one piece.

00:51:55.480 --> 00:51:56.160
Don’t worry,

00:51:57.160 --> 00:51:58.600
thanks for calling.

00:51:58.600 --> 00:51:59.080
Sure.

00:52:00.800 --> 00:52:03.920
It's all a mess. I’m so sorry ..

00:52:03.920 --> 00:52:05.480
Hey!

00:52:05.480 --> 00:52:08.160
that this is all I can do. Hey!

00:52:08.160 --> 00:52:09.480
Ice.

00:52:09.480 --> 00:52:10.760
Hey, Ice!

00:52:11.160 --> 00:52:13.160
Ice, come back here. Ice.

00:52:13.880 --> 00:52:14.400
Ice.

00:52:14.400 --> 00:52:14.880
Don’t go.

00:52:14.880 --> 00:52:15.800
Come back!

00:52:15.800 --> 00:52:16.600
Ice! Don’t go.

00:52:16.600 --> 00:52:17.800
Stop running!

00:52:18.680 --> 00:52:20.000
Let me go!

00:52:20.000 --> 00:52:21.560
Ice. Let me go!

00:52:21.560 --> 00:52:23.000
No.

00:52:23.000 --> 00:52:24.120
Ice, be careful you’ll fall.

00:52:24.120 --> 00:52:25.320
I’m not going to,

00:52:26.280 --> 00:52:28.280
I’m not that drunk, kiddo!

00:52:28.280 --> 00:52:29.400
Sit properly.

00:52:29.400 --> 00:52:30.960
I’m not drunk.

00:52:33.640 --> 00:52:35.040
Ouch.

00:52:39.760 --> 00:52:42.160
Sit still, I’ll wipe you down.

00:52:43.520 --> 00:52:45.120
I’m too tired to sit.

00:52:45.120 --> 00:52:45.880
Come on.

00:52:47.800 --> 00:52:49.200
I don’t want to sit.

00:52:49.840 --> 00:52:51.840
Take off your shirt. Saint.

00:52:54.040 --> 00:52:55.520
Ice, you’ll fall forward.

00:52:55.520 --> 00:52:56.800
I'm not gonna...

00:52:58.600 --> 00:52:59.440
No…

00:52:59.440 --> 00:53:00.720
Just sit for a bit, okay?

00:53:28.440 --> 00:53:36.440
(I’m so sorry that this is all I can do.)

00:53:36.440 --> 00:53:40.600
(Even though I love you so much,)

00:53:40.600 --> 00:53:41.600
( I still hurt you.)

00:53:41.600 --> 00:53:43.440
Ice, sit still.

00:53:43.440 --> 00:53:45.080
Stop,

00:53:45.080 --> 00:53:47.280
if you come in here, you’ll get hit, okay?

00:53:47.280 --> 00:53:49.880
This is my stage.

00:53:52.400 --> 00:53:54.400
(I'm so sorry..)

00:53:54.400 --> 00:53:55.360
Happy now?

00:53:56.080 --> 00:53:58.440
If you’re satisfied, come down and I’ll wipe you.

00:54:00.200 --> 00:54:01.120
Come on.

00:54:01.120 --> 00:54:04.520
Hey, stop! I’ll actually hit you, kid.

00:54:06.200 --> 00:54:07.920
(I’m so sorry that this is all I can do.)

00:54:07.920 --> 00:54:09.320
Come down, hurry. Let go.

00:54:09.320 --> 00:54:10.440
Ow.

00:54:10.440 --> 00:54:11.960
Come down now. Let go.

00:54:11.960 --> 00:54:12.720
Let go.

00:54:12.720 --> 00:54:13.640
Saint!

00:54:20.000 --> 00:54:22.000
Saint,

00:54:22.280 --> 00:54:23.760
I’m sorry.

00:54:23.760 --> 00:54:25.320
Are you okay, Saint?

00:54:25.320 --> 00:54:27.920
Are you hurt? I’m sorry.

00:54:30.480 --> 00:54:32.120
Are you hurt?

00:54:33.080 --> 00:54:35.960
I didn’t mean it, sorry, Saint.

00:54:37.720 --> 00:54:38.880
Saint.

00:54:46.360 --> 00:54:47.440
Saint.

00:54:47.440 --> 00:54:48.280
I’m not hurt.

00:54:50.400 --> 00:54:52.400
If you want to hit me, hit me.

00:54:54.640 --> 00:54:55.880
Sorry,

00:54:56.520 --> 00:54:58.520
you must be hurt.

00:55:00.200 --> 00:55:02.680
I’m sorry for everything, Saint.

00:55:03.680 --> 00:55:04.640
Hmm,

00:55:05.080 --> 00:55:06.360
Saint.

00:55:08.280 --> 00:55:11.880
Whether it’s about school, the paint,

00:55:12.200 --> 00:55:14.200
or me yelling at you.

00:55:14.720 --> 00:55:16.360
I’m sorry.

00:55:16.760 --> 00:55:20.360
You can punch me or yell at me.

00:55:20.360 --> 00:55:22.280
But please don’t disappear from my life,

00:55:22.280 --> 00:55:24.440
okay, Saint?

00:55:24.760 --> 00:55:26.480
Hit me if you want.

00:55:26.480 --> 00:55:27.880
Hit me.

00:55:28.480 --> 00:55:29.000
Hit me.

00:55:29.000 --> 00:55:30.360
Hey Ice, that’s enough.

00:55:30.840 --> 00:55:32.280
Enough.

00:55:37.640 --> 00:55:39.640
I won’t disappear anymore.

00:55:45.160 --> 00:55:46.640
Do you mean it?

00:55:55.240 --> 00:55:56.480
Yeah,

00:55:57.400 --> 00:55:58.920
I promise.

00:56:02.240 --> 00:56:03.680
Sorry

00:56:05.120 --> 00:56:06.800
I was never able to help you.

00:56:12.360 --> 00:56:13.800
Sorry.

00:56:14.440 --> 00:56:16.440
Sorry too, Saint.

00:56:21.240 --> 00:56:22.800
It wasn’t your fault,

00:56:24.800 --> 00:56:30.000
let me help you back from now on.

00:56:39.760 --> 00:56:41.880
Thank you, Saint.

00:56:48.360 --> 00:56:50.360
Saint, thank you.

00:56:54.720 --> 00:56:56.720
When you sober up,

00:56:59.600 --> 00:57:02.240
I’ll tell you the whole truth.

00:57:38.120 --> 00:57:40.120
Why did my outfit change?

00:57:40.360 --> 00:57:41.560
Did you do something to me?

00:57:41.560 --> 00:57:42.320
I didn't.

00:57:42.840 --> 00:57:44.240
You were the one who took everything off.

00:57:44.240 --> 00:57:46.240
Let's see your homework.

00:57:46.240 --> 00:57:47.280
Give it to me.

00:57:47.280 --> 00:57:48.480
Hey,

00:57:48.480 --> 00:57:49.560
let me go. Ow.

00:57:49.560 --> 00:57:51.080
Why do you guys have so many problems?

00:57:51.080 --> 00:57:52.520
Come on and clear it up.

00:57:53.960 --> 00:57:54.920
I like you.

00:57:56.200 --> 00:57:57.560
I really do.

00:58:00.880 --> 00:58:02.080
Saint.

00:58:02.520 --> 00:58:05.280
Do you want to practice the scene with me?
