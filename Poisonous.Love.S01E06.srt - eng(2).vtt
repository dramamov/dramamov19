What are you looking at, my love?

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:26.240
So I can't look at my girlfriend now?

00:00:27.820 --> 00:00:28.820
I love it.

00:00:30.540 --> 00:00:31.840
Come lie by my side.

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:33.160
I have a show picked out.

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:38.070
Let's see.

00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:40.040
Which show?

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:44.320
Can you gimme a hug?

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:50.186
Prem.

00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:51.120
Hm?

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:52.960
Who do you think the bad guy is

00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:54.920
between...

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:56.920
the man by the street

00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:58.760
and that woman?

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:02.380
I think...

00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:05.080
it's the man by the street.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:07.640
He looks strong enough to kill someone.

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:10.420
No,

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:12.040
I think it's the woman.

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:12.880
Hm?

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:15.720
Maybe it's more complicated than it seems.

00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:18.680
Maybe the woman
works together with her secret lover

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:20.480
to kill her husband.

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:22.240
Whoa!

00:01:22.980 --> 00:01:25.000
Your eyebrows are tied into a bow now.

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:27.680
Do you like crime and investigation series?

00:01:28.120 --> 00:01:29.360
I do.

00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:32.000
My dad

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:34.200
was the one showing them to me,

00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:36.040
so I really came to like them.

00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:39.840
I think I'll have to get
to know my girlfriend more.

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:43.280
There seems to be something
even more interesting about you.

00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:48.640
I love you.

00:01:55.900 --> 00:01:57.840
Your hands are so soft.

00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:07.920
And they smell so good.

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:11.800
Are doctors known to have soft hands?

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:13.480
I don't know.

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:18.680
I thought I took really good care of myself,

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:20.360
but after I met you,

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:21.800
I couldn't even compare.

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:26.320
Are you gonna watch the show or not?

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:28.880
I am!

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:33.720
I guess I have to change my lotion
to the one you use.

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:34.640
Really?

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:43.680
I'm sure I got the bad guy right.

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:45.602
The woman you asked me
to do a background check on

00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:48.360
is Pat, Napak Tharanisorn,

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:50.280
a very famous actress of the hour.

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:53.240
An actress?

00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:54.720
Yes, sir.

00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:57.268
Is there anything else
you want me to look for?

00:02:57.800 --> 00:03:00.040
How did this woman know my girlfriend?

00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:06.440
[RAM2 Hospital]

00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:18.040
Prem,

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:20.680
don't you normally avoid this type of food?

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:25.080
I saw you eat it,

00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:27.600
so I thought I should try something new.

00:03:27.740 --> 00:03:28.960
It seems mouthwatering.

00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:31.480
But you don't
normally eat sour mangoes, do you?

00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:35.360
I'm just craving something sour.

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:37.240
- "Craving"?!
- "Craving"?!

00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:41.160
Tan,

00:03:41.460 --> 00:03:42.720
help me get the food tray?

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:44.240
Sure.

00:03:50.060 --> 00:03:51.280
Do you think what I'm thinking?

00:03:57.760 --> 00:03:59.800
[Prem]

00:04:00.901 --> 00:04:02.680
Judging by how bad her craving is,

00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:04.560
does this mean...

00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:25.800
Cut!

00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:27.840
Alright, that's it.

00:04:27.880 --> 00:04:29.480
That's a wrap for the set!

00:04:31.200 --> 00:04:32.440
Someone help her, please.

00:04:33.900 --> 00:04:35.080
Thank you, everyone.

00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:36.680
Thank you so much!

00:04:36.900 --> 00:04:38.640
You've worked so hard!

00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:41.760
Can I take a selfie with all of you?

00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:43.600
Sure, come on, guys.

00:04:48.020 --> 00:04:49.360
Let's do this. Come on.

00:04:49.400 --> 00:04:51.640
Three, two, one...

00:04:53.780 --> 00:04:54.640
Yay!

00:04:54.680 --> 00:04:57.080
- Thank you!
- Thank you.

00:05:01.520 --> 00:05:03.120
I'm all done with work.

00:05:03.160 --> 00:05:04.720
See you at home.

00:05:05.280 --> 00:05:06.000
Pat,

00:05:06.840 --> 00:05:08.120
do you want to celebrate with us?

00:05:10.240 --> 00:05:11.520
I can't.

00:05:11.620 --> 00:05:12.880
I have some errands to run.

00:05:13.680 --> 00:05:15.800
Again, I'm sorry, Sai,

00:05:15.840 --> 00:05:18.080
that I have to rush the process of filming.

00:05:18.440 --> 00:05:19.920
It's all because of the scandal.

00:05:20.280 --> 00:05:21.960
Hey, it's all good.

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:23.720
We know what the truth is.

00:05:23.920 --> 00:05:25.520
We're on your side.

00:05:26.880 --> 00:05:28.320
Thank you.

00:05:28.360 --> 00:05:29.800
Let's work together again next time.

00:05:30.040 --> 00:05:30.760
Sure.

00:05:32.700 --> 00:05:33.700
Pat,

00:05:34.040 --> 00:05:35.920
reporters are here to ask for an interview.

00:05:35.960 --> 00:05:38.720
They want to know more
about how you bailed on the event

00:05:38.760 --> 00:05:41.240
and how you have beef with your manager.

00:05:45.180 --> 00:05:45.920
Pat!

00:05:52.360 --> 00:05:54.360
Cherry, please tell them

00:05:54.400 --> 00:05:56.040
I'm not open to an interview.

00:05:56.080 --> 00:05:57.480
I'm gonna go change now.

00:05:58.080 --> 00:05:58.960
Sure.

00:06:02.080 --> 00:06:02.920
Pat!

00:06:03.300 --> 00:06:04.800
Wait up, Pat!

00:06:10.080 --> 00:06:10.960
Pat,

00:06:11.780 --> 00:06:13.200
I want to talk.

00:06:13.800 --> 00:06:15.600
I thought I made myself clear

00:06:16.680 --> 00:06:18.240
the last time we met.

00:06:18.820 --> 00:06:20.920
Why is it so easy for you to cut me off?

00:06:21.580 --> 00:06:23.560
Does it mean you don't care
about me anymore?

00:06:23.800 --> 00:06:25.280
Are you trying to make up with me

00:06:25.860 --> 00:06:27.920
because that man dumped you again?

00:06:30.480 --> 00:06:31.480
Pat,

00:06:31.520 --> 00:06:33.760
you're an important person in my life.

00:06:33.800 --> 00:06:35.600
Of course, I want to make up with you.

00:06:35.760 --> 00:06:36.640
Is that so?

00:06:38.560 --> 00:06:40.600
I think it's good
that we go our separate ways.

00:06:41.840 --> 00:06:43.680
Why are you so eagerly pushing me away?

00:06:43.720 --> 00:06:45.280
Is it that you're with someone,

00:06:45.700 --> 00:06:47.840
and they stop you from meeting me?

00:06:48.420 --> 00:06:50.440
No one's stopping me, Nam.

00:06:50.980 --> 00:06:52.360
This is my decision.

00:06:53.120 --> 00:06:55.200
Then, can't you just forgive me?

00:06:55.520 --> 00:06:57.320
Let's go back to the way we were.

00:06:57.660 --> 00:07:00.400
The doctor said
I shouldn't be too stressed out,

00:07:00.560 --> 00:07:02.200
so if you don't care about me,

00:07:02.240 --> 00:07:04.080
please do it for the sake of my baby,

00:07:04.440 --> 00:07:05.880
your nibling.

00:07:08.500 --> 00:07:09.840
Who said I'd take the baby as my nibling?

00:07:10.280 --> 00:07:12.600
The child has a father, so that's his job.

00:07:13.160 --> 00:07:14.960
If you don't want to be swarmed
by reporters,

00:07:15.400 --> 00:07:16.960
take the back exit.

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:20.560
And don't come to my workplace again.

00:08:05.200 --> 00:08:07.000
I miss you.

00:08:09.760 --> 00:08:10.880
I miss you, too.

00:08:12.400 --> 00:08:14.160
I have some good news for you.

00:08:15.600 --> 00:08:16.880
What good news?

00:08:17.460 --> 00:08:18.960
Tomorrow and the day after,

00:08:19.220 --> 00:08:20.480
I can take two days off.

00:08:20.660 --> 00:08:21.760
Should we go on a vacation?

00:08:22.840 --> 00:08:23.600
Let's do it!

00:08:24.320 --> 00:08:25.560
But...

00:08:26.080 --> 00:08:28.200
are you free, Ms. Starlet?

00:08:29.520 --> 00:08:30.520
I am.

00:08:30.560 --> 00:08:32.840
From now on, all my free time

00:08:32.880 --> 00:08:34.320
belongs to you.

00:08:34.900 --> 00:08:36.120
Where should we go?

00:08:36.360 --> 00:08:37.080
Let's go.

00:08:37.820 --> 00:08:38.640
Go where?

00:08:40.040 --> 00:08:41.160
We can decide later.

00:08:41.200 --> 00:08:41.960
Let's just go.

00:08:42.080 --> 00:08:42.800
Huh?

00:08:43.100 --> 00:08:44.000
Where?

00:08:44.540 --> 00:08:46.120
We haven't even had anything planned!

00:08:46.780 --> 00:08:48.480
We don't need one.

00:08:48.800 --> 00:08:50.400
We don't even need to bring our clothes!

00:08:50.440 --> 00:08:51.760
Just buy new ones when we get there.

00:08:51.960 --> 00:08:53.000
It's exciting that way!

00:08:54.220 --> 00:08:55.120
Fine,

00:08:55.800 --> 00:08:56.800
let's go on a vacation.

00:09:22.480 --> 00:09:24.320
Do you like coming to the beach, Prem?

00:09:28.160 --> 00:09:29.600
Well, it's beautiful

00:09:30.040 --> 00:09:32.320
in every corner possible.

00:09:37.240 --> 00:09:38.400
Even more so than me?

00:09:41.520 --> 00:09:43.246
Are you trying to win a beach?

00:09:48.320 --> 00:09:49.600
Alright,

00:09:50.560 --> 00:09:51.720
you're prettier.

00:09:52.780 --> 00:09:53.960
Good.

00:09:55.840 --> 00:09:57.800
Considering how needy you are,

00:09:58.540 --> 00:10:00.000
you were a spoiled girl, weren't you?

00:10:00.620 --> 00:10:02.240
Is that why you're so spoiled now?

00:10:03.340 --> 00:10:06.080
I'm only like this around you.

00:10:06.120 --> 00:10:08.160
So that's the privilege I get?

00:10:08.800 --> 00:10:09.800
Exactly.

00:10:09.840 --> 00:10:11.160
If I'm not in love with someone,

00:10:11.200 --> 00:10:12.380
I won't be stubborn with them.

00:10:13.720 --> 00:10:15.200
Then...

00:10:15.920 --> 00:10:18.280
get ready to be taught a lesson.

00:10:18.500 --> 00:10:19.800
Do it!

00:10:19.840 --> 00:10:21.200
Teach me tons!

00:10:21.660 --> 00:10:23.920
Do it. I'm into it.

00:10:26.340 --> 00:10:27.600
You're weird.

00:10:38.780 --> 00:10:40.120
Are you still sleepy?

00:10:40.800 --> 00:10:42.200
Do you want to take another nap?

00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:44.080
No,

00:10:47.160 --> 00:10:49.240
let's go shopping and check into our room!

00:11:09.180 --> 00:11:10.560
You're a messy eater.

00:11:12.520 --> 00:11:13.520
Let me clean it for you.

00:11:33.580 --> 00:11:34.760
All clean.

00:11:41.120 --> 00:11:42.840
Why are you pocketing your food?

00:11:43.840 --> 00:11:45.640
You're all grown up, not a child.

00:11:56.000 --> 00:11:57.680
Chew it slowly

00:11:58.340 --> 00:11:59.720
and nicely,

00:11:59.920 --> 00:12:01.320
or you'll choke.

00:12:09.760 --> 00:12:10.880
Now, drink some water.

00:12:14.560 --> 00:12:15.560
Good job.

00:12:41.600 --> 00:12:42.480
Hey,

00:12:43.160 --> 00:12:45.400
didn't I tell you not to pocket your food,

00:12:45.560 --> 00:12:47.040
my naughty girl?

00:12:47.200 --> 00:12:48.200
I'm not gonna be nice now.

00:12:51.680 --> 00:12:53.440
Quick, chew your food!

00:13:00.360 --> 00:13:01.360
Chew!

00:13:08.773 --> 00:13:10.120
Now!

00:13:17.240 --> 00:13:18.440
Good job.

00:13:18.720 --> 00:13:20.320
Be nice, okay?

00:13:22.180 --> 00:13:23.800
I'll quit messing with you.

00:13:26.100 --> 00:13:27.600
Do that again and I'll scold you.

00:13:29.280 --> 00:13:30.000
Alright.

00:13:53.880 --> 00:13:55.480
♫All this time,♫

00:13:55.520 --> 00:13:58.696

That's beautiful, Prem!

00:16:20.200 --> 00:16:21.920
Why are you so talented?

00:16:23.860 --> 00:16:25.080
You're a doctor,

00:16:25.120 --> 00:16:26.600
a swimmer,

00:16:26.640 --> 00:16:28.000
and also a musician!

00:16:28.560 --> 00:16:30.120
That's too flattering.

00:16:30.980 --> 00:16:32.200
It's not.

00:16:32.960 --> 00:16:35.207
My girlfriend is the best!

00:16:50.360 --> 00:16:51.360
Give me a sec, Pat.

00:16:58.400 --> 00:16:59.760
[Mother]

00:17:01.240 --> 00:17:02.440
Yes, Mother?

00:17:06.560 --> 00:17:07.560
That's right.

00:17:08.120 --> 00:17:09.080
Uh,

00:17:09.120 --> 00:17:11.400
I forgot to tell you that

00:17:11.440 --> 00:17:12.800
I couldn't make it today.

00:17:13.320 --> 00:17:14.760
I...

00:17:18.920 --> 00:17:20.680
I'm caught up in an urgent matter.

00:17:23.160 --> 00:17:23.920
Right.

00:17:24.620 --> 00:17:25.840
See you next week.

00:17:26.360 --> 00:17:27.680
I love you, too.

00:17:40.480 --> 00:17:42.120
Why didn't you tell her

00:17:42.160 --> 00:17:43.600
you weren't caught up in an urgent matter

00:17:44.240 --> 00:17:45.400
but a girlfriend?

00:17:45.980 --> 00:17:46.980
Pat!

00:17:47.920 --> 00:17:49.120
Just kidding!

00:17:49.560 --> 00:17:51.200
Was that something urgent?

00:17:51.900 --> 00:17:52.900
It was nothing.

00:17:53.840 --> 00:17:56.920
I just forgot
I have dinner planned with my family today.

00:17:57.280 --> 00:17:58.400
We do that every Friday.

00:17:58.680 --> 00:17:59.880
Oh...

00:18:02.740 --> 00:18:05.320
But the reason I didn't tell her
I was with you

00:18:05.940 --> 00:18:08.240
is not that I wanted to hide it from them.

00:18:09.320 --> 00:18:10.320
It's just that...

00:18:11.360 --> 00:18:13.520
I have never been with a woman before.

00:18:14.320 --> 00:18:15.520
I understand.

00:18:16.360 --> 00:18:18.320
I wasn't gonna blame you for it.

00:18:18.660 --> 00:18:20.280
We can go at your pace.

00:18:20.720 --> 00:18:23.520
Tell your mother whenever you'd like.

00:18:28.460 --> 00:18:31.000
Thank you for your understanding.

00:18:32.560 --> 00:18:35.320
My mother is quite old-fashioned,

00:18:36.520 --> 00:18:38.280
but she really does love me.

00:18:39.020 --> 00:18:40.500
She can give me the world.

00:18:44.920 --> 00:18:46.240
Even this violin.

00:18:46.820 --> 00:18:48.520
If it wasn't for her,

00:18:48.560 --> 00:18:49.960
I wouldn't be able to play it.

00:18:52.660 --> 00:18:54.920
You really, really love your mother,
don't you?

00:18:56.440 --> 00:18:57.160
Yes.

00:18:58.080 --> 00:18:59.120
That's perfect.

00:18:59.160 --> 00:19:00.920
I love a family-oriented person

00:19:00.960 --> 00:19:02.920
since I also love my parents deeply.

00:19:03.500 --> 00:19:05.840
Papa and Mama really like you.

00:19:06.480 --> 00:19:08.400
They're dying to make you
their daughter-in-law.

00:19:10.040 --> 00:19:11.040
Really?

00:19:11.480 --> 00:19:12.480
Really,

00:19:12.760 --> 00:19:13.840
no joke.

00:19:15.160 --> 00:19:16.160
Alright, then.

00:19:16.680 --> 00:19:18.360
You can take me to meet them.

00:19:19.140 --> 00:19:20.720
Though,

00:19:21.560 --> 00:19:23.520
you need to go somewhere with me.

00:19:25.640 --> 00:19:27.040
I have a surprise for you.

00:20:15.388 --> 00:20:16.588
Do you like it?

00:20:18.048 --> 00:20:19.308
I love it!

00:20:19.348 --> 00:20:20.468
I couldn't be more in love!

00:20:23.868 --> 00:20:25.228
What a relief.

00:20:26.208 --> 00:20:27.988
I thought this was gonna be too outdated.

00:20:29.108 --> 00:20:30.108
Not at all.

00:20:31.268 --> 00:20:32.628
I really love it.

00:20:33.248 --> 00:20:34.988
This is so romantic!

00:20:36.748 --> 00:20:38.268
I'm glad you like it.

00:21:02.508 --> 00:21:12.068
♫No words needed to realize you're the one♫

Hm?

00:21:46.828 --> 00:21:49.068
I have a gift for you.

00:21:49.528 --> 00:21:50.728
What gift?

00:21:55.308 --> 00:22:04.988
♫Nothing compares

This is adorable!

00:22:25.748 --> 00:22:29.148
Do you know why I gave you this dollhouse?

00:22:31.608 --> 00:22:34.628
It's because I want to spend
the rest of my life with you.

00:22:41.428 --> 00:22:42.788
Thank you, Pat.

00:22:43.348 --> 00:22:44.860
I really love it.

00:22:46.028 --> 00:22:48.133
I'm happy that you do.

00:22:51.468 --> 00:22:52.748
But...

00:22:53.808 --> 00:22:55.628
seeing how you went all out like this,

00:22:56.368 --> 00:22:57.748
will it even be a competition?

00:22:58.388 --> 00:22:59.508
Will what be?

00:23:02.288 --> 00:23:03.268
Are you saying...

00:23:03.308 --> 00:23:05.388
I also have a gift for you.

♫The final answer to my prayers♫

Calm down.

00:23:19.628 --> 00:23:20.628
Open your gift first.

00:23:26.268 --> 00:23:32.548
♫The final answer to my prayers♫

These are heart-shaped,
just like your pendant!

00:23:38.388 --> 00:23:39.228
Exactly,

00:23:41.268 --> 00:23:42.828
I gave you my heart,

00:23:43.988 --> 00:23:45.788
so we can match.

00:23:47.228 --> 00:23:48.428
I'll put them on for you.

00:24:59.268 --> 00:25:00.628
Why are you crying?

00:25:02.548 --> 00:25:04.348
Don't you like them?

00:25:08.828 --> 00:25:10.308
I'm just so happy.

00:25:12.188 --> 00:25:13.908
Three or four days ago,

00:25:13.948 --> 00:25:16.668
I thought I was gonna get
my heart broken for you.

00:25:34.888 --> 00:25:37.028
Now, you're my girlfriend,

00:25:38.108 --> 00:25:40.548
and you're even doing
something romantic for me.

00:25:51.988 --> 00:25:53.348
Don't cry, Pat.

00:25:56.608 --> 00:25:58.108
Over the years,

00:25:58.148 --> 00:26:00.868
I've never had any luck in love, Prem.

00:26:01.528 --> 00:26:03.828
Those I loved never loved me back.

00:26:06.508 --> 00:26:09.908
You're now my one and only, Prem.

00:26:15.588 --> 00:26:17.748
You're also my one and only, Pat.

00:26:19.188 --> 00:26:21.228
You're even my first love.

00:26:24.668 --> 00:26:28.028
Even if I had to cry hundreds of times more
because of that awful man

00:26:28.068 --> 00:26:29.388
just to eventually meet you,

00:26:31.188 --> 00:26:32.188
I'd happily do it.

00:26:35.868 --> 00:26:37.188
Thank you

00:26:38.848 --> 00:26:41.828
for making me realize
how exceptional love can be.

00:27:34.788 --> 00:27:35.788
Morning, Pat.

00:27:42.068 --> 00:27:43.588
Are you laughing at my face?

00:27:43.948 --> 00:27:45.108
No,

00:27:46.208 --> 00:27:47.988
I'm just thinking
about how adorable you are.

00:27:49.148 --> 00:27:52.308
Who knew you liked matching items?

00:27:55.608 --> 00:27:57.108
Don't you like it?

00:27:58.748 --> 00:28:00.588
Whatever you like

00:28:00.868 --> 00:28:02.428
is what I'm into.

00:28:11.528 --> 00:28:13.308
I don't want to get up.

00:28:13.948 --> 00:28:15.188
But it's time to.

00:28:16.068 --> 00:28:17.828
Come on, let's take a shower.

00:28:18.228 --> 00:28:19.988
We need to leave in the afternoon.

00:28:21.268 --> 00:28:23.508
But I don't want to.

00:28:24.868 --> 00:28:26.508
I'll take you here again sometime.

00:28:31.008 --> 00:28:31.868
Really?

00:28:33.308 --> 00:28:34.228
Mm.

00:28:35.468 --> 00:28:36.568
Fine, I'll get up.

00:28:38.188 --> 00:28:40.388
But you'll have to take me to the bathroom.

00:28:41.008 --> 00:28:42.428
I'm too lazy to even move a leg.

00:28:45.468 --> 00:28:47.268
What a cunning one.

00:29:12.428 --> 00:29:15.108
Come on, let's take a shower.

00:29:17.308 --> 00:29:19.188
Take off my clothes, please?

00:29:43.868 --> 00:29:52.148
♫With you by my side,
there's nothing else I'd like♫

00:29:52.568 --> 00:29:57.428
♫You're the love I'm longing for♫

00:29:57.468 --> 00:30:01.984

♫My heart will belong to you forever♫

00:30:33.948 --> 00:30:35.268
She's your friend, isn't she?

00:30:37.708 --> 00:30:40.068
Isn't that your ex?

00:30:40.108 --> 00:30:41.508
Don't act so innocent.

00:30:42.788 --> 00:30:45.308
You told your little friend
to mess with her head, didn't you?

00:30:45.708 --> 00:30:48.228
That doctor is the one messing with my head!

00:30:48.268 --> 00:30:49.668
Watch your mouth.

00:30:50.268 --> 00:30:51.468
I hate that witch.

00:30:52.188 --> 00:30:53.388
She took you from me,

00:30:53.428 --> 00:30:54.628
and now Pat!

00:30:54.668 --> 00:30:55.668
Unbelievable...

00:30:56.828 --> 00:30:58.868
- You're disgusting!
- Ow!

00:30:58.908 --> 00:31:00.708
I can't deal with you anymore!

00:31:01.148 --> 00:31:02.948
I can't with you either!

00:31:04.068 --> 00:31:06.228
Be my guest and go back to that woman;

00:31:06.268 --> 00:31:07.348
I'll go back to Pat!

00:31:07.388 --> 00:31:08.748
You're a douchebag!

00:31:08.908 --> 00:31:09.668
Bastard!

00:31:09.828 --> 00:31:11.508
Get out of my house, now!!

00:31:11.548 --> 00:31:13.388
- Get the hell out!
- Damn it!

00:31:14.748 --> 00:31:15.548
Ow...

[Nam]

00:32:25.308 --> 00:32:26.628
Is Nam...

00:32:27.268 --> 00:32:28.788
that friend of yours?

00:32:34.168 --> 00:32:35.668
Why don't you pick up her call?

00:32:41.988 --> 00:32:43.228
I don't want to.

00:32:43.688 --> 00:32:45.348
I want this to be our time.

00:32:47.848 --> 00:32:48.848
Just take it

00:32:49.688 --> 00:32:51.068
in case something happens.

00:33:02.588 --> 00:33:03.508
Hello?

00:33:04.068 --> 00:33:04.868
Pat...

00:33:05.588 --> 00:33:06.395
Blood...

00:33:07.028 --> 00:33:08.708
There's blood everywhere...

00:33:10.188 --> 00:33:12.268
Please help me and my baby, Pat...

00:33:12.968 --> 00:33:14.268
I have no one left...

00:33:15.708 --> 00:33:16.508
Nam!

00:33:16.988 --> 00:33:18.068
Just hold on.

00:33:18.108 --> 00:33:19.468
I'll be there as soon as possible!

00:33:19.768 --> 00:33:20.908
Stay calm, Nam,

00:33:21.028 --> 00:33:22.268
and don't hang up.

00:33:23.688 --> 00:33:24.468
Prem,

00:33:24.508 --> 00:33:26.828
can you call an ambulance for me?

00:33:28.508 --> 00:33:29.508
Hey, Nam.

00:33:29.548 --> 00:33:30.468
Are you still there?

00:33:33.268 --> 00:33:34.348
Hello, Nam?!

00:34:07.616 --> 00:34:08.496
Pat...

00:34:11.376 --> 00:34:12.256
My baby...

00:34:15.696 --> 00:34:16.940
What about my baby?

00:34:20.736 --> 00:34:21.714
My baby...

00:34:25.376 --> 00:34:26.976
What about my baby?

00:34:27.696 --> 00:34:29.656
What happened to my baby, Pat?

00:34:30.216 --> 00:34:32.016
My baby?

00:34:32.416 --> 00:34:34.416
What about my baby...

00:34:34.704 --> 00:34:35.976
It's gonna be alright, Nam.

00:34:38.576 --> 00:34:41.376
I have no one left, Pat...

00:34:44.536 --> 00:34:45.536
Pat,

00:34:45.816 --> 00:34:47.456
please don't leave me.

00:34:50.976 --> 00:34:53.136
Please don't go anywhere.

00:34:54.616 --> 00:34:57.481
Please don't leave me, Pat...

00:34:58.976 --> 00:35:00.376
Please...

00:35:05.736 --> 00:35:08.376
I have no one left...

00:35:28.416 --> 00:35:29.296
Prem!

00:35:29.996 --> 00:35:30.996
What are you doing here?

00:35:32.096 --> 00:35:33.296
Isn't this your day off?

00:35:34.656 --> 00:35:37.136
Just dealing with some business.

00:35:39.426 --> 00:35:40.339
Come sit.

00:35:46.136 --> 00:35:47.136
Sit down.

00:35:52.036 --> 00:35:52.936
Prem,

00:35:53.436 --> 00:35:55.336
can I ask you something?

00:35:57.096 --> 00:35:58.256
Have you...

00:36:01.136 --> 00:36:02.136
started your prenatal care?

00:36:02.176 --> 00:36:02.976
Huh?

00:36:03.976 --> 00:36:04.976
Prenatal care?

00:36:07.136 --> 00:36:08.576
I know you're pregnant,

00:36:08.816 --> 00:36:10.136
but you don't have to be worried.

00:36:11.176 --> 00:36:12.536
We've thought this through.

00:36:12.756 --> 00:36:13.756
Thought what through?

00:36:16.896 --> 00:36:18.016
Prem, let's get married.

00:36:19.136 --> 00:36:21.096
I'll be the father of your child.

00:36:21.656 --> 00:36:22.937
Your baby

00:36:22.977 --> 00:36:24.856
will legally have a father,

00:36:24.896 --> 00:36:27.176
and you don't have
to give any answers to the public.

00:36:27.336 --> 00:36:29.016
We'll help you raise your baby.

00:36:29.056 --> 00:36:30.296
Don't you worry.

00:36:30.336 --> 00:36:31.576
We'll work it out together.

00:36:33.236 --> 00:36:34.776
Wait, wait, wait.

00:36:36.096 --> 00:36:38.136
You got it all wrong.

00:36:38.976 --> 00:36:40.376
I'm not pregnant!

00:36:43.336 --> 00:36:44.736
No need to be embarrassed around us.

00:36:46.576 --> 00:36:47.896
I'm not embarrassed.

00:36:48.616 --> 00:36:50.656
I'm just genuinely not pregnant!

00:36:52.036 --> 00:36:52.816
What?

00:36:53.216 --> 00:36:54.976
But you slipped up that night, didn't you?

00:36:57.416 --> 00:36:58.576
Bow, Tan,

00:37:01.576 --> 00:37:02.696
that night...

00:37:04.696 --> 00:37:06.416
I slept with a woman,

00:37:06.456 --> 00:37:07.776
not a man!

00:37:23.536 --> 00:37:24.776
Let's have this talk later.

00:37:40.496 --> 00:37:42.496
Have you figured out
why your friend miscarried?

00:37:44.056 --> 00:37:45.416
Because of that man.

00:37:46.036 --> 00:37:46.936
They got into a fight,

00:37:46.976 --> 00:37:48.936
and he pushed her into a stair railing.

00:37:49.936 --> 00:37:51.656
Thawat did that?

00:37:54.776 --> 00:37:55.776
Well...

00:37:56.596 --> 00:37:57.816
is your friend alright?

00:37:58.976 --> 00:38:00.176
She's the opposite of that.

00:38:12.336 --> 00:38:13.336
Prem,

00:38:15.836 --> 00:38:18.136
there's something about her
that I need to tell you.

00:38:20.896 --> 00:38:22.736
I want to make things clear

00:38:22.776 --> 00:38:24.376
so that there's nothing to hide between us.

00:38:27.256 --> 00:38:28.336
What is it?

00:38:30.416 --> 00:38:32.456
I liked Nam more than a friend,

00:38:35.216 --> 00:38:36.976
but it's all in the past now.

00:38:38.096 --> 00:38:39.256
You were together?

00:38:40.136 --> 00:38:41.136
No,

00:38:42.796 --> 00:38:44.696
it was one-sided.

00:38:45.976 --> 00:38:48.016
I don't have any feelings for her anymore.

00:38:48.696 --> 00:38:50.456
You're the only one I love.

00:38:51.096 --> 00:38:51.816
So...

00:38:52.736 --> 00:38:55.016
what are you trying to tell me?

00:38:55.816 --> 00:38:57.376
Nam has no one by her side,

00:38:58.576 --> 00:39:00.936
so I'll have to take care of her
for the time being.

00:39:02.016 --> 00:39:03.776
Please don't be mad at me.

00:39:06.696 --> 00:39:08.296
Why would I be?

00:39:09.196 --> 00:39:11.296
It could make you uncomfortable...

00:39:14.216 --> 00:39:15.376
I'm fine.

00:39:17.196 --> 00:39:19.456
You gotta help your friend
through a tough time.

00:39:30.536 --> 00:39:31.856
I'm gonna leave now.

00:39:31.896 --> 00:39:32.976

00:39:33.016 --> 00:39:34.016
Just go.

00:39:39.096 --> 00:39:40.736
Let me walk you.

00:39:41.656 --> 00:39:43.176
I can walk by myself.

00:39:45.136 --> 00:39:47.936
I'm not a weak woman who can't be alone.

00:40:39.296 --> 00:40:41.576
I really, really miss you.

00:40:41.616 --> 00:40:42.946
I want your hug.

00:40:52.376 --> 00:40:54.536
I liked Nam more than a friend,

00:40:55.936 --> 00:40:57.696
but it's all in the past now.

[RAM2 Hospital]

00:41:44.036 --> 00:41:44.856
Hey,

00:41:45.256 --> 00:41:47.176
do you really think
I hid a whole person in here?

00:41:48.016 --> 00:41:49.336
The most dangerous place...

00:41:49.376 --> 00:41:50.936
is usually the safest place.

00:41:54.036 --> 00:41:55.416
Shoot your questions.

00:41:57.316 --> 00:41:59.416
I can't believe you did it with a woman!

00:42:00.296 --> 00:42:01.216
Prem,

00:42:01.256 --> 00:42:02.656
you've never been with a woman,

00:42:02.956 --> 00:42:04.976
and you're very careful with your actions,

00:42:06.756 --> 00:42:07.976
so what exactly happened?

00:42:09.056 --> 00:42:10.976
Do you think I was joking?

00:42:11.436 --> 00:42:12.256
No,

00:42:12.296 --> 00:42:13.736
but there must be a reason

00:42:13.776 --> 00:42:15.616
you decided to do it, right?

00:42:21.736 --> 00:42:22.936
This time...

00:42:24.376 --> 00:42:25.536
there was no reason for it.

00:42:27.256 --> 00:42:28.696
That's out of character!

00:42:29.416 --> 00:42:31.136
And what's going on now between you

00:42:31.176 --> 00:42:32.176
and that woman?

00:42:36.356 --> 00:42:37.536
Well...

who the lucky lady is!

00:42:50.016 --> 00:42:51.536
You'll see.

00:42:54.816 --> 00:42:55.576
Hey...

00:42:55.616 --> 00:42:56.816
How did you get in?!

00:42:56.856 --> 00:42:58.136
What are you going to do to my friend?

00:43:00.576 --> 00:43:03.216
This is not a place
to look for your friend's partner.

00:43:08.936 --> 00:43:10.736
I'm really sorry,

00:43:11.976 --> 00:43:13.536
you two,

00:43:13.576 --> 00:43:14.976
that I made you upset.

00:43:21.196 --> 00:43:23.216
But Prem and I

00:43:23.416 --> 00:43:24.696
are girlfriends now.

00:43:30.216 --> 00:43:31.896
I can explain.

00:43:33.296 --> 00:43:35.176
Then, meet us at the cafeteria at lunch!

00:43:35.576 --> 00:43:36.296
Mm!

00:43:46.736 --> 00:43:48.256
Are you okay, Prem?

00:43:49.576 --> 00:43:50.576
I am.

00:43:51.216 --> 00:43:52.936
I was planning to tell them anyway.

00:43:56.216 --> 00:43:57.936
I really miss you, Prem.

00:43:58.216 --> 00:43:59.936
Do you miss me?

00:44:01.216 --> 00:44:02.216
Well,

00:44:02.856 --> 00:44:04.016
a little.

00:44:05.216 --> 00:44:06.216
Ow,

00:44:07.016 --> 00:44:08.016
why was that?

00:44:10.736 --> 00:44:12.296
Just kidding!

00:44:14.176 --> 00:44:15.936
Have you had your breakfast?

00:44:16.096 --> 00:44:17.176
Already.

00:44:18.016 --> 00:44:18.896
Right,

00:44:19.216 --> 00:44:20.936
I bought a sandwich for you.

00:44:29.616 --> 00:44:30.736
You're the best!

00:44:36.056 --> 00:44:37.056
Last night,

00:44:38.196 --> 00:44:40.676
you didn't...

00:44:42.416 --> 00:44:44.576
cry yourself to bed
because you missed me, did you?

00:44:45.776 --> 00:44:47.536
Who'd do that?

00:44:48.456 --> 00:44:49.556
No clue.

00:44:54.376 --> 00:44:55.976
You didn't get to sleep much, Pat?

00:44:58.096 --> 00:45:01.176
Why do you look so cheerless?

00:45:05.696 --> 00:45:07.776
I didn't get to sleep until 2 A.M.

00:45:10.976 --> 00:45:12.416
Is she doing better?

00:45:15.296 --> 00:45:16.656
She is,

00:45:17.376 --> 00:45:19.056
but she's still grieving.

00:45:19.096 --> 00:45:21.216
She gets frantic every time I'm not around.

00:45:24.016 --> 00:45:25.616
Wouldn't she be mad

00:45:26.016 --> 00:45:27.136
that you came down here?

00:45:28.536 --> 00:45:29.976
Let her.

00:45:30.196 --> 00:45:31.536
I'm not a prisoner,

00:45:31.796 --> 00:45:33.896
so why would I be with her all the time?

00:45:41.156 --> 00:45:42.776
I have a girlfriend now.

00:45:44.516 --> 00:45:46.256
I gotta be with my girlfriend, right?

00:45:50.976 --> 00:45:53.416
Then, today,

00:45:53.456 --> 00:45:55.256
if you have time,

00:45:55.936 --> 00:45:57.816
let's have lunch with my friends.

00:46:27.764 --> 00:46:29.644
You know about Prem and that woman, Sita?

00:46:30.924 --> 00:46:31.724
I do.

00:46:32.044 --> 00:46:33.444
Then, why didn't you say something,

00:46:33.484 --> 00:46:35.044
leaving me worried for so long?

00:46:35.684 --> 00:46:38.444
Because Prem asked me
not to tell you and Tan.

00:46:38.924 --> 00:46:40.644
You should've let me in on it anyway.

00:46:42.604 --> 00:46:43.924
Bow, are you mad at me?

00:46:44.924 --> 00:46:45.924
A little.

00:46:46.564 --> 00:46:47.644
Well...

00:46:47.684 --> 00:46:49.764
how should I make it up to you?

00:46:51.204 --> 00:46:52.764
Tonight...

00:46:52.804 --> 00:46:54.684
should I spend another night at your place?

00:46:57.204 --> 00:46:58.404
That's so unfair.

00:46:59.324 --> 00:47:00.244
How so?

00:47:00.797 --> 00:47:03.797
How could I ever stay mad
at someone as pretty as you?

00:47:06.644 --> 00:47:08.444
If you're not mad at me anymore,

00:47:09.084 --> 00:47:11.164
then you have to behave

00:47:11.384 --> 00:47:13.044
while we meet with Prem's girlfriend,

00:47:13.444 --> 00:47:14.444
alright?

00:47:28.044 --> 00:47:29.964
I don't know exactly what happened,

00:47:30.164 --> 00:47:33.084
but we respect your decision, Prem.

00:47:33.124 --> 00:47:34.124
That's right.

00:47:34.324 --> 00:47:36.884
But if you ever make her sad...

00:47:39.804 --> 00:47:41.764
If that ever happens,

00:47:42.364 --> 00:47:44.284
you guys can gang up on me.

00:47:53.684 --> 00:47:55.364
Cut the act!

00:47:55.964 --> 00:47:57.364
You're scaring Pat.

00:48:00.404 --> 00:48:02.044
Thank you, Sita.

00:48:03.524 --> 00:48:04.604
Let's eat.

00:48:14.324 --> 00:48:15.364
You made this, Pat?

00:48:15.524 --> 00:48:16.404
I did.

00:48:31.224 --> 00:48:32.124
Pat,

00:48:34.644 --> 00:48:36.244
there you go, pocketing your food again.

00:48:37.684 --> 00:48:38.684
Chew!

00:48:39.444 --> 00:48:40.564
Quick, chew it.

00:48:42.724 --> 00:48:43.724
Great job.

00:48:46.484 --> 00:48:47.404
Bow,

00:48:47.804 --> 00:48:49.364
there you go, pocketing your food again.

00:48:49.404 --> 00:48:50.404
Quick, chew it.

00:48:55.204 --> 00:48:56.224
Tan,

00:48:56.444 --> 00:48:57.724
that's my job.

00:49:00.444 --> 00:49:01.964
Big bite!

00:49:02.964 --> 00:49:04.524
So, Tan, you're still single?

00:49:23.484 --> 00:49:25.284
I appreciate you, Prem,

00:49:25.324 --> 00:49:27.204
for introducing me to your friends.

00:49:28.544 --> 00:49:30.084
It's alright.

00:49:30.444 --> 00:49:31.444
Nothing unusual.

00:49:31.884 --> 00:49:33.604
It might be for you,

00:49:33.644 --> 00:49:35.924
but it means the world to me.

00:49:39.564 --> 00:49:41.604
Now, go back up there.

00:49:42.484 --> 00:49:43.844
Your friend must be waiting.

00:49:46.604 --> 00:49:48.324
I'll come back down here again.

00:49:48.964 --> 00:49:50.391
It's fine.

00:49:51.884 --> 00:49:53.484
Didn’t you say

00:49:53.764 --> 00:49:55.564
that if you disappeared,

00:49:55.604 --> 00:49:57.084
she'd get frantic?

00:50:01.004 --> 00:50:02.164
Then...

00:50:02.484 --> 00:50:04.444
wait for me after work,

00:50:04.484 --> 00:50:05.924
so we can go home together.

00:50:06.284 --> 00:50:08.804
Just sort things out with your friend first.

00:50:12.164 --> 00:50:13.484
I told you,

00:50:13.804 --> 00:50:16.764
I'm not a weak woman who can't be alone.

00:50:18.984 --> 00:50:21.884
But I want you to be lost without me.

00:50:23.924 --> 00:50:24.924
You're so extra.

00:50:27.004 --> 00:50:28.244
Now, go!

00:50:28.764 --> 00:50:31.004
I have to go back to the patients, too.

00:50:31.644 --> 00:50:36.324
♫You make my heart flutter♫

00:50:36.364 --> 00:50:40.964
♫You make me melt
every time you lean closer♫

00:50:41.004 --> 00:50:45.515
♫Your gaze makes me lose my mind♫

00:50:45.724 --> 00:50:50.644
♫You're the only one I want by my side♫

00:50:53.284 --> 00:50:54.484
Where were you?

00:50:58.564 --> 00:50:59.844
It's personal.

00:51:00.264 --> 00:51:01.224
Why?

00:51:01.264 --> 00:51:03.724
So I don't get to be
in your personal life anymore?

00:51:04.404 --> 00:51:05.764
I'm that bad a person?

00:51:05.924 --> 00:51:07.844
I'm the worst there is, aren't I?

00:51:08.844 --> 00:51:10.924
That's not what I meant.

00:51:12.604 --> 00:51:14.324
Or do you hate me now?

00:51:15.724 --> 00:51:16.644
I don't.

00:51:16.804 --> 00:51:19.124
Then, don't leave me here by myself!

00:51:19.444 --> 00:51:20.724
I'm scared.

00:51:26.564 --> 00:51:28.244
No one's gonna hurt you.

00:51:28.884 --> 00:51:29.884
Yes, they are.

00:51:29.924 --> 00:51:30.924
While you were away,

00:51:30.964 --> 00:51:32.964
that was when Thawat came in and hurt me.

00:51:33.184 --> 00:51:34.724
Don't leave me, Pat.

00:51:35.124 --> 00:51:36.884
I have no one left.

00:51:38.444 --> 00:51:39.924
Don't say that, Nam.

00:51:40.524 --> 00:51:42.284
You still have your parents

00:51:42.744 --> 00:51:44.724
and your family.

00:51:45.364 --> 00:51:46.364
You know full well

00:51:46.404 --> 00:51:48.804
how my family back home is.

00:51:51.764 --> 00:51:54.324
And does that man know
he made you like this?

00:51:54.884 --> 00:51:56.978
You should really have
a serious talk with him.

00:51:57.444 --> 00:51:58.844
It's no use, Pat.

00:51:58.884 --> 00:52:01.204
He's probably happy
that I had a miscarriage.

00:52:01.564 --> 00:52:03.484
I don't need him anymore

00:52:03.924 --> 00:52:05.444
as long as I have you,

00:52:05.804 --> 00:52:07.204
only you.

00:52:08.164 --> 00:52:09.804
Pat, promise

00:52:09.944 --> 00:52:11.484
you won't leave me.

00:52:12.924 --> 00:52:14.484
Promise me,

00:52:14.524 --> 00:52:15.404
please.

00:52:18.844 --> 00:52:20.924
Please, Pat. Promise me...

00:52:25.124 --> 00:52:26.124
I promise.

00:53:58.021 --> 00:53:59.284
Sorry,

00:53:59.324 --> 00:54:02.444
the number you've dialed
cannot be reached at this moment.

00:54:57.084 --> 00:54:57.964
Doctor!
