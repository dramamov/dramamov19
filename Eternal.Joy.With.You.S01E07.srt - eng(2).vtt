00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:12.040
Hey, kid,

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:13.560
let me take a look.

00:01:30.790 --> 00:01:31.630
Come on.

00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:37.960
Beat him.

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:40.920
Are you crazy? Get out.

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:41.760
Let me take a look.

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:42.790
Get out.

00:01:43.510 --> 00:01:44.840
Are you looking for someone?

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:46.790
Yes.

00:01:46.870 --> 00:01:48.310
Earlier, I noticed them

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:49.870
taking kids over there.

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:51.280
Go and take a look.

00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:52.760
Thank you.

00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:55.760
Come here.

00:01:56.150 --> 00:01:57.230
Watch and learn.

Does it hurt?

00:05:14.700 --> 00:05:16.210
On the surface, slaves are traded here.

00:05:16.870 --> 00:05:18.480
But secretly there are duels, gambling,

00:05:18.750 --> 00:05:20.080
and trafficking of young children.

00:05:21.310 --> 00:05:23.510
We intercepted the carriage
headed for the border

00:05:23.830 --> 00:05:24.920
and were able to rescue him.

00:05:25.800 --> 00:05:27.800
They are utterly heartless.

00:05:28.360 --> 00:05:29.560
They won't get away with this.

00:05:30.950 --> 00:05:32.430
Is that so?

00:05:32.680 --> 00:05:35.310
Then let's see if you can leave today.

00:05:35.600 --> 00:05:38.480
These children are bound to me
by death contracts.

00:05:38.480 --> 00:05:40.190
You can't take him away.

00:05:51.510 --> 00:05:52.350
Surround them.

00:05:58.950 --> 00:06:00.560
Commander, they're all surrounded.

00:06:01.430 --> 00:06:02.920
According to imperial law,

00:06:03.390 --> 00:06:05.000
those who traffic and abuse children

00:06:05.510 --> 00:06:06.680
shall be sentenced to hanging.

00:06:07.160 --> 00:06:08.040
Take them away.

00:06:08.510 --> 00:06:09.350
Aye.

00:06:10.560 --> 00:06:11.430
Move.

00:06:11.430 --> 00:06:12.270
In this world,

00:06:12.510 --> 00:06:14.720
some people's lives are insignificant
as weeds.

00:06:15.270 --> 00:06:17.000
Some stand high above others

00:06:17.630 --> 00:06:18.800
and yet do evil without mercy.

00:06:21.070 --> 00:06:21.910
Rest assured.

00:06:23.120 --> 00:06:24.480
These children and slaves

00:06:24.680 --> 00:06:26.160
will be cared for by the authorities.

00:06:27.510 --> 00:06:28.680
Thank you today.

00:06:33.750 --> 00:06:34.830
From this day on,

00:06:35.270 --> 00:06:37.390
I will never let anyone hurt you again.

00:06:38.510 --> 00:06:39.350
Hmm.

00:06:48.600 --> 00:06:49.750
She saved me.

00:06:50.120 --> 00:06:52.560
I want to take her with us, is that okay?

00:06:54.680 --> 00:06:55.520
Of course.

00:07:04.040 --> 00:07:05.800
By the way, where is Cui Yunfeng?

00:07:06.120 --> 00:07:08.390
When I arrived, I saw he'd been knocked out.

00:07:08.800 --> 00:07:10.750
So I threw him into the slave dueling pit.

00:07:11.040 --> 00:07:12.950
Perhaps he's still alive.

00:07:12.950 --> 00:07:14.270
- Let's go.
- He better be alive.

00:07:14.720 --> 00:07:16.430
He mustn't die so easily.

00:07:27.240 --> 00:07:28.120
From now on,

00:07:28.120 --> 00:07:29.240
don't be afraid anymore.

00:07:29.390 --> 00:07:31.360
I will never let anyone hurt you again.

00:07:31.360 --> 00:07:32.200
Do you understand?

00:07:35.120 --> 00:07:37.750
You can call me Aunt Ning, all right?

00:07:41.630 --> 00:07:43.270
I'd decided what your name would be

00:07:43.510 --> 00:07:45.000
a very long time ago.

00:07:45.870 --> 00:07:46.710
Chang'an.

00:07:48.190 --> 00:07:51.160
It means you'll have
eternal joy and peace.

00:07:51.830 --> 00:07:52.670
All right?

00:07:56.040 --> 00:07:57.160
And you're

00:07:57.680 --> 00:07:58.520
Ruyi.

00:07:58.720 --> 00:08:00.270
It means all your wishes will come true.

00:08:00.950 --> 00:08:02.070
Thank you, Aunt Ning.

00:08:05.750 --> 00:08:07.000
Since you've found your child,

00:08:07.600 --> 00:08:08.630
you don't have to go back.

00:08:09.480 --> 00:08:10.720
If you want to divorce,

00:08:11.120 --> 00:08:11.960
I will help you.

00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:15.750
No leads yet on the Hongzhen Incense.

00:08:16.240 --> 00:08:17.720
You've helped me so much,

00:08:17.950 --> 00:08:19.360
I must repay your kindness.

00:08:20.190 --> 00:08:21.030
Besides,

00:08:21.600 --> 00:08:23.310
I haven't settled my score

00:08:23.600 --> 00:08:24.630
with that family yet.

00:08:26.800 --> 00:08:29.360
Are you taking them back as well?

00:08:29.430 --> 00:08:31.070
We have no other place to go.

00:08:31.390 --> 00:08:32.390
Leaving them out there

00:08:32.390 --> 00:08:33.750
isn't an option.

00:08:35.120 --> 00:08:36.360
I have a separate manor.

00:08:37.270 --> 00:08:38.200
If you trust me,

00:08:38.550 --> 00:08:39.790
you can settle them there.

00:08:40.400 --> 00:08:41.240
Rest assured.

00:08:41.360 --> 00:08:42.750
I will send people to protect them.

00:08:43.690 --> 00:08:45.210
That way, you can proceed without fear.

00:08:46.910 --> 00:08:48.360
Now you have two soft spots,

00:08:49.480 --> 00:08:50.960
if you take them back,

00:08:51.390 --> 00:08:53.360
no one can guarantee their safety.

00:08:56.270 --> 00:08:57.840
I see your point.

00:08:58.720 --> 00:08:59.560
Commander Pei,

00:09:00.870 --> 00:09:01.910
I trust you.

00:09:04.790 --> 00:09:05.630
Then,

00:09:06.720 --> 00:09:07.560
thank you so much.

00:09:11.630 --> 00:09:12.480
I hope we both

00:09:14.240 --> 00:09:16.150
get what we wish for.

00:09:27.200 --> 00:09:28.790
When we arrived at the slave pit,

00:09:28.790 --> 00:09:29.790
we found the Marquis

00:09:29.790 --> 00:09:31.910
lying there, covered in injuries.

00:09:31.960 --> 00:09:32.960
Where is Xu Wanning?

00:09:33.440 --> 00:09:34.840
I didn't see her.

00:09:36.030 --> 00:09:37.320
Mother, were you looking for me?

00:09:40.480 --> 00:09:41.320
Xu Wanning!

00:09:42.910 --> 00:09:44.360
It was you who hurt Feng!

00:09:45.080 --> 00:09:46.320
Mother, you must be joking.

00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:48.510
How could a weak woman

00:09:48.600 --> 00:09:49.720
like myself have the ability

00:09:49.720 --> 00:09:50.960
to injure my husband?

00:09:51.480 --> 00:09:52.870
This was not my doing.

00:09:53.270 --> 00:09:54.360
On my way back,

00:09:54.360 --> 00:09:55.870
I heard that Yunfeng was injured,

00:09:56.120 --> 00:09:57.870
so I even went to bring the Master Physician.

00:10:06.790 --> 00:10:08.550
Yunfeng is injured so badly.

00:10:10.510 --> 00:10:11.390
Mother,

00:10:13.870 --> 00:10:15.480
can you now understand the pain

00:10:16.030 --> 00:10:17.720
of seeing your child hurt?

00:10:19.870 --> 00:10:20.790
Then do you know

00:10:21.630 --> 00:10:24.080
what the child you abandoned six years ago

00:10:24.270 --> 00:10:25.670
looks like now?

00:10:26.510 --> 00:10:29.480
Now that your child has been found,

00:10:30.030 --> 00:10:33.120
you had better behave from now on.

00:10:34.910 --> 00:10:35.750
Of course.

00:10:38.150 --> 00:10:38.990
Lady Cui,

00:10:39.630 --> 00:10:41.750
let me check the Marquis's injuries.

00:10:43.120 --> 00:10:43.960
Please.

00:11:01.480 --> 00:11:02.320
Lady Cui,

00:11:02.870 --> 00:11:03.750
most of the injuries

00:11:04.080 --> 00:11:05.840
are external wounds.

00:11:06.120 --> 00:11:07.150
Days of rest will suffice.

00:11:09.840 --> 00:11:10.790
However,

00:11:16.080 --> 00:11:17.480
one part on the Marquis

00:11:18.440 --> 00:11:19.630
is seriously injured.

00:11:20.750 --> 00:11:21.600
I'm afraid

00:11:24.390 --> 00:11:26.240
he may no longer be able to be intimate.

00:11:26.720 --> 00:11:27.560
What?

00:11:48.600 --> 00:11:49.440
What?

00:11:49.910 --> 00:11:50.750
Impotent?

00:11:52.630 --> 00:11:53.470
No.

00:11:53.670 --> 00:11:54.670
It can't be.

00:11:54.930 --> 00:11:56.200
It must be that vixen Xu Wanning.

00:11:56.200 --> 00:11:57.040
She…

00:11:57.910 --> 00:11:58.870
Stop yelling.

00:11:59.440 --> 00:12:00.910
You're still breathing.

00:12:02.960 --> 00:12:05.320
I will find a doctor to cure you.

00:12:07.390 --> 00:12:09.000
She is the one who ruined me.

00:12:13.120 --> 00:12:14.910
How dare she bring me to this?

00:12:16.600 --> 00:12:18.440
I must destroy her.

00:12:19.720 --> 00:12:22.080
Back then, only her wealth

00:12:23.120 --> 00:12:24.550
and the Princess's backing

00:12:24.670 --> 00:12:26.510
made me accept her.

00:12:27.120 --> 00:12:30.030
Now, out of respect for the Princess,

00:12:30.630 --> 00:12:32.670
we can't simply cast her out.

00:12:33.390 --> 00:12:34.910
Since you want to torment her,

00:12:35.720 --> 00:12:37.670
we still need to come up with a plan.

00:12:40.200 --> 00:12:42.150
For now, focus on getting better.

00:12:44.150 --> 00:12:45.630
Bai Qingqing is locked up,

00:12:46.390 --> 00:12:48.000
but Xu Wanning is unreliable.

00:12:49.030 --> 00:12:50.630
It's better to have her take care of me.

00:12:51.510 --> 00:12:52.550
Hmm.

00:13:23.600 --> 00:13:25.320
Have you thought over

00:13:26.240 --> 00:13:27.360
what we discussed earlier?

00:13:27.870 --> 00:13:28.710
Just once.

00:13:29.630 --> 00:13:31.390
Ma Si, don't even think about it.

00:13:32.030 --> 00:13:33.120
Don't forget,

00:13:33.240 --> 00:13:34.750
I am the Marquis's woman.

00:13:37.840 --> 00:13:40.080
They have kept you locked up for days.

00:13:40.270 --> 00:13:42.000
The Marquis has long forgotten you.

00:13:43.360 --> 00:13:44.280
Moreover,

00:13:44.910 --> 00:13:48.270
the Marquis is no longer capable now.

00:13:48.960 --> 00:13:50.080
What happened to the Marquis?

00:13:50.390 --> 00:13:52.510
The Marquis has become impotent.

00:13:52.790 --> 00:13:53.790
Nonsense!

00:13:58.080 --> 00:13:59.790
Still dare to run?

00:14:04.870 --> 00:14:06.960
- Let me go!
- Shut up.

00:14:10.390 --> 00:14:11.600
How dare you scream?

00:14:11.960 --> 00:14:14.600
Looks like I get to enjoy
the finer things today.

00:14:14.870 --> 00:14:16.630
Let go of me! Help!

00:14:17.670 --> 00:14:21.240
Marquis, help me!

00:14:25.600 --> 00:14:27.840
I asked Cuiyun, the servant of Lady Cui.

00:14:28.320 --> 00:14:31.440
She said the Hongzhen Incense

00:14:31.600 --> 00:14:33.630
was from Cui Yunfeng's study.

00:14:34.510 --> 00:14:36.360
But she was only following orders

00:14:36.550 --> 00:14:37.910
and didn't know what was inside.

00:14:39.360 --> 00:14:40.670
Have you checked his study?

00:14:41.630 --> 00:14:42.840
I searched it many times

00:14:43.150 --> 00:14:45.910
but found nothing related to it.

00:14:48.510 --> 00:14:49.440
What about you?

00:14:49.720 --> 00:14:50.910
Did you find anything?

00:14:52.200 --> 00:14:55.320
Do you know Lady Cui secludes herself
to chant Buddhist sutras

00:14:55.390 --> 00:14:56.510
on the 1st and 15th monthly?

00:14:57.510 --> 00:14:59.630
Yes, she does have that habit.

00:15:00.910 --> 00:15:03.480
Do you think that's suspicious?
