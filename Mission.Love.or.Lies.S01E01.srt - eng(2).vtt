00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:33.520
Would you like a massage, darling?

00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:44.960
Do you like it?

00:00:57.280 --> 00:00:58.560
I knew about you all along.

00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:00.360
Who sent you here?

00:01:01.240 --> 00:01:02.360
You won't escape anyway,

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:05.840
because I've planted time bombs all around this house.

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:10.760
Well, before we die,

00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:13.640
let's have some fun together.

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:39.680
Dream!

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:48.840
Hey, it's already 7:30.

00:02:57.680 --> 00:02:59.080
Dreaming again?

00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:02.920
When will it become real?

00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:13.640
Oh no, it's already 7:30!

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:16.800
Better get to work.

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:19.160
Let's go, let's go to work.

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:23.560
Give me a kiss to brighten my day like in the dream.

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:27.160
Let's go to work. Hurry up!

00:03:34.960 --> 00:03:39.920

00:03:43.080 --> 00:03:47.920

Kitty, Nunthaphuck Aranyakasemsuk as Chama

00:04:25.160 --> 00:04:26.880
Hello.

00:05:22.760 --> 00:05:24.080
Are you Achi?

00:05:25.080 --> 00:05:26.640
We're ready. Shall we go now?

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:32.640
Hey, you.

00:05:34.760 --> 00:05:35.480
You.

00:05:36.560 --> 00:05:37.400
Hey, you.

00:05:40.760 --> 00:05:42.640
I'm sorry, I didn't get much sleep.

00:05:45.120 --> 00:05:47.280
I'm ready. I've prepared the room for you.

00:05:48.080 --> 00:05:48.640
Please come in.

00:05:55.160 --> 00:05:57.120
After the recent assassination attempt,

00:05:57.400 --> 00:06:01.840
this morning, Miss Praepanrai Siwatchaponlaglai, Patty,

00:06:01.840 --> 00:06:04.040
the daughter of Sire Phirom, along with her close bodyguard,

00:06:04.360 --> 00:06:06.280
has returned to Thailand.

00:06:06.280 --> 00:06:10.200
Plain-clothes police have escorted her to a safe location.

00:06:10.320 --> 00:06:12.800
Police Lieutenant Colonel Natee Veerachakul,

00:06:12.800 --> 00:06:14.120
or Inspector Tee,

00:06:14.440 --> 00:06:17.360
revealed to reporters that he wants everyone to feel at ease.

00:06:17.600 --> 00:06:20.720
"Everyone can rest assured because the police department

00:06:20.720 --> 00:06:23.680
is taking very good care of and protecting Patty.

00:06:23.960 --> 00:06:25.880
Right now, she's staying at a place

00:06:25.880 --> 00:06:29.200
provided by the police department, under complete protection and security."

00:06:37.480 --> 00:06:39.120
You two don't need to worry.

00:06:41.360 --> 00:06:45.000
Especially you, Patty. I will protect you to the best of my ability.

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:49.920
How long do we have to stay here?

00:06:50.360 --> 00:06:52.280
Until the situation improves

00:06:52.680 --> 00:06:56.080
and the police can arrest the criminals who attacked your father.

00:07:10.520 --> 00:07:12.200
Patty, don't worry.

00:07:14.360 --> 00:07:17.680
You will be safe and return home to your father.

00:07:20.840 --> 00:07:22.240
Keep it down a little.

00:07:23.840 --> 00:07:26.960
Show some consideration. This is Miss Patty.

00:07:29.720 --> 00:07:33.520
You two should rest. I'll go check the security outside.

00:07:55.080 --> 00:07:56.320
Hello, P'Tee.

00:07:56.880 --> 00:07:57.720
How is it?

00:07:58.440 --> 00:08:00.640
Everything's fine. Just arrived at the hotel.

00:08:01.160 --> 00:08:02.840
What about Patty? Is she being difficult?

00:08:03.800 --> 00:08:04.880
Not at all.

00:08:05.320 --> 00:08:08.560
Everything's fine. She's not as troublesome as you said.

00:08:09.520 --> 00:08:10.720
Really? That's strange.

00:08:11.720 --> 00:08:12.960
But she's beautiful, right?

00:08:14.360 --> 00:08:16.040
Very beautiful.

00:08:16.520 --> 00:08:20.920
The atmosphere here is getting better. Otherwise, it would be so boring.

00:08:21.880 --> 00:08:25.640
Hey, don't talk like that. I've already made plans, don't worry.

00:08:26.560 --> 00:08:29.120
I'll send someone to stay with you so you won't be lonely.

00:08:29.880 --> 00:08:30.920
Who?

00:08:32.040 --> 00:08:33.480
Don't tell me...

00:08:33.640 --> 00:08:35.600
Yes, Chama. Come on.

00:08:38.800 --> 00:08:40.080
Can we change people?

00:08:40.320 --> 00:08:42.600
If she comes, it'll be chaos.

00:08:42.800 --> 00:08:46.720
Come on, I don't think anyone else is more suitable than her.

00:08:47.040 --> 00:08:48.160
Suitable for what?

00:08:48.800 --> 00:08:51.240
If she comes, will probably...

00:08:51.240 --> 00:08:54.880
Hey, another call. That's all for now, Achi. I'll call tomorrow.

00:08:54.880 --> 00:08:56.920
P'Tee! P'Tee!

00:09:06.400 --> 00:09:07.480
Achi!

00:09:08.760 --> 00:09:10.040
Here already, you troublemaker.

00:09:13.040 --> 00:09:20.760
I missed you so much! We haven't seen each other in so long.

00:09:21.280 --> 00:09:24.120
How did you get here, Chama? How did you know I was here?

00:09:24.640 --> 00:09:27.960
I followed my heart.

00:09:27.960 --> 00:09:31.040
Wherever there's Achi, there's Chama.

00:09:31.400 --> 00:09:34.640
Achi-Chama, Chama-Achi.

00:09:38.480 --> 00:09:43.280
Let me remind you that this place isn't as comfortable as home.

00:09:43.720 --> 00:09:46.040
You can still go back now. I give you permission.

00:09:46.640 --> 00:09:50.640
Oh, come on! I made the effort to come find you.

00:09:51.320 --> 00:09:54.920
Two heads are better than one, right?

00:09:56.240 --> 00:09:57.440
Well, okay, fine.

00:09:59.280 --> 00:10:00.720
If you want to stay, stay.

00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:04.200
But let me say this first: don't cause any trouble here.

00:10:04.200 --> 00:10:07.440
Otherwise, I'll send you straight back home, no matter what.

00:10:07.640 --> 00:10:09.360
Okay, understood.

00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:14.440
Chama will be Achi's best assistant, I promise.

00:10:27.040 --> 00:10:28.280
This is Chama.

00:10:29.360 --> 00:10:30.240
Hello.

00:10:30.800 --> 00:10:31.480
Hello.

00:10:31.720 --> 00:10:34.200
Chama will help take care of this mission.

00:10:35.320 --> 00:10:38.880
If there's anything I can help with, just let me know. I'll do my best, don't hold back.

00:10:40.040 --> 00:10:41.440
Don't overdo it, Chama.

00:10:41.960 --> 00:10:43.800
There's nothing more for today.

00:10:43.800 --> 00:10:47.000
Patty must be tired from traveling. Let's all go rest.

00:10:47.680 --> 00:10:48.400
Wait a minute.

00:10:48.880 --> 00:10:52.560
Are you telling all of us to sleep cramped together in this tiny room?

00:10:53.160 --> 00:10:53.960
I don't think so.

00:10:54.840 --> 00:10:55.680
No.

00:10:56.080 --> 00:10:59.520
There's another room prepared here. We'll split up 2-2.

00:10:59.680 --> 00:11:01.160
Then I'll sleep with Patty.

00:11:01.320 --> 00:11:02.480
Then I'll sleep with Achi.

00:11:04.200 --> 00:11:04.960
No.

00:11:05.080 --> 00:11:08.080
There's a room specifically prepared for bodyguards.

00:11:08.080 --> 00:11:09.600
You must sleep with me, Alice.

00:11:13.800 --> 00:11:15.280
And you, Chama,

00:11:15.600 --> 00:11:17.960
you must stay and watch over Miss Patty in this room.

00:11:36.160 --> 00:11:36.920
Oh!

00:11:59.868 --> 00:12:02.748
Sponsored by Nom Pro Fresh

00:12:17.828 --> 00:12:20.988
This bodyguard room is pretty big too.

00:12:21.748 --> 00:12:23.508
I thought it would be as small as a mouse hole.

00:12:24.508 --> 00:12:27.708
We're here to work, not as victims.

00:12:28.068 --> 00:12:29.708
We should sleep comfortably.

00:12:30.228 --> 00:12:32.708
Well, Patty's room is right next door.

00:12:33.268 --> 00:12:35.148
Great, I can visit easily.

00:12:35.908 --> 00:12:37.748
I think I'll go take a shower.

00:12:38.068 --> 00:12:39.508
What business do you have going in there?

00:12:40.028 --> 00:12:40.748
Nothing.

00:12:41.308 --> 00:12:42.148
Are you sure?

00:12:42.708 --> 00:12:43.428
Mm-hmm.

00:12:56.308 --> 00:12:58.148
Hey, Chama.

00:12:58.428 --> 00:13:01.708
Tonight, you sleep on the bed. I'll sleep on the sofa.

00:13:02.228 --> 00:13:05.308
Oh no, I'll sleep on the sofa.

00:13:18.108 --> 00:13:18.868
Ouch!

00:13:24.308 --> 00:13:26.268
Ouch!

00:13:32.388 --> 00:13:34.428
No need, I'll get it myself.

00:13:35.308 --> 00:13:37.508
I don't know if my head is cracked.

00:13:41.668 --> 00:13:44.908
Ouch! Does it hurt?

00:13:56.028 --> 00:13:58.188
Let me blow on it for you.

00:14:22.428 --> 00:14:25.428
Hey, your head is just as red.

00:14:31.828 --> 00:14:33.588
What kind of person has such a hard head?

00:14:40.228 --> 00:14:42.308
You, hey you.

00:14:42.988 --> 00:14:43.868
What?

00:14:44.268 --> 00:14:47.028
Can you get me the pajamas from my bag?

00:14:47.948 --> 00:14:48.988
Ew!

00:14:49.628 --> 00:14:52.628
What? Can't you help a little? No consideration at all.

00:14:53.348 --> 00:14:56.308
Come on, why don't you wrap a towel and come get it yourself?

00:14:56.588 --> 00:14:58.108
I'm not your servant.

00:14:59.308 --> 00:15:01.628
I don't know how to wrap a towel.

00:15:02.908 --> 00:15:04.948
What kind of crazy person doesn't know how to wrap a towel?

00:15:05.428 --> 00:15:06.868
Someone like me.

00:15:06.868 --> 00:15:08.388
Hurry up.

00:15:09.308 --> 00:15:12.748
If you don't get it for me, I'll just strip and go get it myself.

00:15:14.748 --> 00:15:16.268
Wait, wait, wait!

00:15:16.548 --> 00:15:17.788
Please, calm down.

00:15:18.588 --> 00:15:19.548
I'll get it for you.

00:15:23.548 --> 00:15:25.068
Hurry up.

00:15:25.068 --> 00:15:26.748
Just a second.

00:15:34.668 --> 00:15:37.868
Here, take it.

00:15:38.588 --> 00:15:39.308
Take it.

00:15:39.628 --> 00:15:40.988
And get dressed properly.

00:15:42.788 --> 00:15:43.548
Why?

00:15:43.868 --> 00:15:46.308
We're both bodyguards, what's there to be embarrassed about?

00:15:47.308 --> 00:15:49.548
I don't like seeing other people's stuff.

00:15:54.668 --> 00:15:55.268
Ugh!

00:15:56.548 --> 00:15:58.268
So annoying. No privacy at all.

00:16:04.428 --> 00:16:05.508
Hello, Phirom.

00:16:06.148 --> 00:16:08.028
Inspector Tee, please sit.

00:16:10.708 --> 00:16:11.788
Have you eaten anything?

00:16:12.108 --> 00:16:14.548
Not yet, sir. But it's okay.

00:16:14.548 --> 00:16:18.828
I wanted to come update you about Patty first. I was worried you'd be concerned.

00:16:19.468 --> 00:16:20.668
Is everything alright?

00:16:21.668 --> 00:16:23.548
Right now, everything is going according to plan.

00:16:23.548 --> 00:16:26.108
Patty is in a safe location.

00:16:26.108 --> 00:16:29.228
She's well protected by uniformed police. You can rest assured.

00:16:30.268 --> 00:16:31.868
Has she caused any problems for the team?

00:16:32.668 --> 00:16:33.428
None at all.

00:16:33.428 --> 00:16:37.868
According to my subordinates' reports, Patty is quite obedient and sweet.

00:16:38.068 --> 00:16:39.588
She's not at all like what you described.

00:16:40.188 --> 00:16:40.828
That's good.

00:16:44.628 --> 00:16:46.588
What about the criminals? Any progress?

00:16:47.348 --> 00:16:49.468
We're currently tracking the leads.

00:16:49.468 --> 00:16:53.308
I have enough evidence to trace back to the source.

00:16:53.708 --> 00:16:56.308
I guarantee we'll close this case for certain, sir.

00:16:57.188 --> 00:16:59.708
If it's as you say, that would be good.

00:17:01.348 --> 00:17:05.468
As for me, I don't know if I'll die today or tomorrow.

00:17:07.188 --> 00:17:08.548
I'm only worried about my daughter.

00:17:09.908 --> 00:17:11.668
Patty only has me.

00:17:13.308 --> 00:17:17.228
I just want her to live happily in Thailand, that's all.

00:17:17.708 --> 00:17:19.868
I understand, sir. I give you my word

00:17:20.268 --> 00:17:25.428
that I will bring the criminals to justice in this case, absolutely.

00:17:25.708 --> 00:17:26.388
Drinking water.

00:17:29.548 --> 00:17:30.428
Thank you.

00:17:35.388 --> 00:17:36.308
Have some water first.

00:17:36.908 --> 00:17:38.828
Stay and have dinner with me before you go.

00:17:39.428 --> 00:17:40.268
Thank you, sir.

00:17:43.628 --> 00:17:45.268
Anyway, thank you so much for today.

00:17:47.668 --> 00:17:48.308
You're welcome.

00:17:59.668 --> 00:18:00.868
Sigh...

00:18:01.188 --> 00:18:03.708
The atmosphere here is quite nice.

00:18:13.588 --> 00:18:15.228
Better close things with P'Tee.

00:18:17.668 --> 00:18:19.628
Otherwise, they'll say we're unprofessional.

00:18:21.228 --> 00:18:24.308
P'Tee, what are you doing?

00:18:24.548 --> 00:18:25.548
Asleep yet?

00:18:29.508 --> 00:18:30.828
Probably already sleeping.

00:18:31.348 --> 00:18:35.988
I'm so jealous. Getting to sleep comfortably at home. Sigh!

00:18:41.468 --> 00:18:42.788
Not yet, but almost.

00:18:43.788 --> 00:18:46.748
Yeah. Everyone's about to sleep here.

00:18:46.948 --> 00:18:49.228
Really? Why aren't you sleeping yet, Achi?

00:18:49.908 --> 00:18:52.868
Can't sleep. Probably because it's a different place.

00:18:53.588 --> 00:18:55.788
I met with Phirom today.

00:18:58.708 --> 00:18:59.908
How did it go?

00:19:00.548 --> 00:19:04.028
Just reported about his daughter arriving safely at the accommodation as usual.

00:19:05.228 --> 00:19:07.028
What do we need to do tomorrow?

00:19:07.548 --> 00:19:10.348
Nothing yet. Just waiting for orders.

00:19:10.868 --> 00:19:13.268
If there's anything urgent, I'll call and let you know.

00:19:14.028 --> 00:19:16.268
Understood.

00:19:16.868 --> 00:19:19.908
Sigh! One day down.

00:19:27.988 --> 00:19:29.468
Hello, viewers.

00:19:29.468 --> 00:19:32.108
We're now with Inspector Natee Veerachakul.

00:19:32.108 --> 00:19:33.948
What's the current situation?

00:19:34.268 --> 00:19:35.748
The current situation is this:

00:19:35.748 --> 00:19:38.268
After Phirom was attacked

00:19:38.268 --> 00:19:40.828
after serving as chairman of the anti-drug campaign,

00:19:41.068 --> 00:19:43.948
the police department hasn't been sitting idle.

00:19:43.948 --> 00:19:47.788
We're trying to find evidence and rushing to catch the criminals for punishment as quickly as possible.

00:19:48.708 --> 00:19:51.828
I understand Minister Phirom is very worried about his daughter.

00:19:52.108 --> 00:19:56.028
The police department has taken her to a safe location

00:19:56.028 --> 00:19:58.548
and is providing 24-hour protection.

00:19:58.708 --> 00:19:59.628
Don't worry.

00:20:06.188 --> 00:20:08.948
Hey, are you going to be in the bathroom much longer?

00:20:16.508 --> 00:20:18.548
You must be turning into a prune from all that bathing.

00:20:19.348 --> 00:20:22.308
Wait a sec, almost done, almost done.

00:20:22.788 --> 00:20:24.588
I'm counting to 5.

00:20:24.828 --> 00:20:28.148
If you're not out, I'm not waiting anymore. Fair warning.

00:20:30.268 --> 00:20:31.108
One.

00:20:32.428 --> 00:20:33.268
Two.

00:20:34.108 --> 00:20:36.228
- Three.
- Done, done!

00:20:40.948 --> 00:20:42.308
So slow!

00:20:48.468 --> 00:20:51.148
In this condition, they wouldn't call this "done."

00:20:55.068 --> 00:20:57.908
Seriously, how did you pass training?

00:20:58.668 --> 00:21:02.148
You're so slow. How can you take care of anyone?

00:21:02.388 --> 00:21:05.468
I really feel sorry for Miss Patty having to be with someone like you.

00:21:06.828 --> 00:21:08.868
Look, I can manage.

00:21:10.068 --> 00:21:12.308
Don't act like you're a burden.

00:21:12.748 --> 00:21:16.708
I just finished training. I need to gain experience first, naturally.

00:21:17.028 --> 00:21:19.828
Who's going to be perfect from birth? Try to understand a little.

00:21:20.748 --> 00:21:23.508
So unlucky to have to work with someone like you.

00:21:24.188 --> 00:21:25.668
Well...

00:21:26.548 --> 00:21:28.108
I'll get better on my own.

00:21:28.988 --> 00:21:31.188
Then you can teach me.

00:21:31.628 --> 00:21:35.188
Why should I be the one to teach someone like you?

00:21:35.748 --> 00:21:38.948
We're on the same team. We should help each other out.

00:21:39.548 --> 00:21:41.188
Try to have some consideration in what you say.

00:21:42.748 --> 00:21:44.108
I can help you.

00:21:44.628 --> 00:21:48.108
But since you came after me and I came first,

00:21:48.708 --> 00:21:51.828
you have to call me Senior.

00:21:52.228 --> 00:21:53.828
Come on, try saying it.

00:21:54.588 --> 00:21:55.308
Senior.

00:21:57.308 --> 00:21:58.508
I can't hear you.

00:21:59.948 --> 00:22:02.508
Senior, Senior, Senior!

00:22:02.828 --> 00:22:04.068
Clear enough?

00:22:07.028 --> 00:22:07.868
Very good.

00:22:08.788 --> 00:22:12.828
But I'll call you Junior.

00:22:14.548 --> 00:22:15.748
Call me whatever you want.

00:22:19.068 --> 00:22:19.868
Just remember,

00:22:20.388 --> 00:22:25.308
when I tell you to do something, you have to do what I say.

00:22:36.748 --> 00:22:38.028
I forgot one more thing.

00:22:38.668 --> 00:22:40.868
I'm very tough.

00:22:41.988 --> 00:22:44.068
Prepare to take the impact,

00:22:45.228 --> 00:22:46.148
Junior.

00:22:46.308 --> 00:22:47.748
Yes.

00:22:50.388 --> 00:22:51.748
Um, the thing is...

00:22:52.708 --> 00:22:54.108
How do I wear this outfit?

Oops! Coffee.

00:23:48.456 --> 00:23:50.216
Wait! Where are you going?

00:23:50.216 --> 00:23:52.376
Can't I have coffee first, Senior?

00:23:52.696 --> 00:23:54.896
We haven't done any work yet. How can you drink coffee?

00:23:55.456 --> 00:23:57.816
Patty won't mind.

00:23:58.816 --> 00:24:03.976
Look, Patty must be very nice to you to let you behave so badly.

00:24:04.376 --> 00:24:07.616
With another boss, you'd have been fired from the first moment.

00:24:07.616 --> 00:24:09.216
That's too much, Senior.

00:24:09.216 --> 00:24:10.216
It's not too much.

00:24:10.896 --> 00:24:13.456
Seriously, are you really a bodyguard?

00:24:14.576 --> 00:24:15.696
Oh well...

00:24:15.896 --> 00:24:17.176
It's just today.

00:24:17.176 --> 00:24:20.576
Normally I work well every day. Patty always compliments me.

00:24:22.216 --> 00:24:22.936
Wait.

00:24:23.656 --> 00:24:26.376
I think I'll make spaghetti for Patty.

00:24:30.816 --> 00:24:32.856
Um, Senior, do you know how to cook?

00:24:33.136 --> 00:24:34.376
It doesn't look that hard.

00:24:34.656 --> 00:24:36.736
Then make some for me too. I'll go sit and wait.

00:24:37.136 --> 00:24:38.936
Sure, go ahead. You're in the way.

00:25:18.576 --> 00:25:19.536
Done.

00:25:19.936 --> 00:25:21.056
Oh, this.

00:25:21.816 --> 00:25:23.056
Wow!

00:25:23.896 --> 00:25:25.096
It looks really good.

00:25:27.496 --> 00:25:28.896
And it's delicious too.

00:25:29.696 --> 00:25:30.616
Then I'll try it.

00:25:42.936 --> 00:25:43.936
It's so delicious!

00:25:44.656 --> 00:25:45.896
Chef-level skills!

00:25:46.976 --> 00:25:47.896
Of course.

00:26:03.056 --> 00:26:04.976
How do I wear this shirt?

00:26:06.896 --> 00:26:09.776
Where does this strap go?

00:26:12.776 --> 00:26:13.816
What kind of outfit is this?

00:26:18.536 --> 00:26:19.536

Um, the thing is...

00:26:30.896 --> 00:26:32.336
How do I wear this outfit?

00:26:33.136 --> 00:26:34.256
Uh...

00:26:37.016 --> 00:26:40.056
Patty, I think you're wearing it inside out.

00:26:41.176 --> 00:26:42.056
Inside out?

00:26:43.536 --> 00:26:45.496
Let me help you.

00:26:46.216 --> 00:26:46.776
Mm-hmm.

00:26:48.616 --> 00:26:50.356
You need to turn this around to the back.

00:26:58.536 --> 00:27:00.896
This strap goes around the neck.

00:27:38.176 --> 00:27:38.896
All done.

00:27:40.936 --> 00:27:42.816
Is it done?

00:27:43.616 --> 00:27:45.016
Thank you.

00:27:45.536 --> 00:27:46.896
By the way...

00:27:47.136 --> 00:27:51.136
When you bought this, didn't you ask the shop how to wear it?

00:27:52.776 --> 00:27:53.456
Oh.

00:27:54.376 --> 00:27:56.736
I think I forgot.

00:28:00.016 --> 00:28:00.976
Forgot?

00:28:01.656 --> 00:28:06.616
But a fashionista like you should know how to wear it.

00:28:09.656 --> 00:28:10.896
Never mind.

00:28:11.896 --> 00:28:13.936
I'm hungry.

00:28:14.816 --> 00:28:15.696
Let's go find something to eat.

00:28:16.656 --> 00:28:17.176
Mm-hmm.

00:28:22.336 --> 00:28:23.456
Are you up?

00:28:24.896 --> 00:28:27.616
Yes, and already dressed.

00:28:28.456 --> 00:28:29.296
Good.

00:28:29.296 --> 00:28:30.656
Food is ready.

00:28:30.776 --> 00:28:32.936
You can bring Patty to the dining room.

00:28:34.456 --> 00:28:36.336
Okay, okay. We were just about to walk over.

00:28:37.096 --> 00:28:38.416
See you in the dining room.

00:28:39.376 --> 00:28:39.936
Mm-hmm.

00:28:41.856 --> 00:28:42.416
Hey!

00:28:43.256 --> 00:28:46.136
I forgot to message P'Tee. Better report in.

00:28:47.336 --> 00:28:49.416
P'Tee, what are you doing?

00:28:49.416 --> 00:28:51.856
Right now at the hotel, we're having a meal.

00:29:05.416 --> 00:29:08.056
Wow, the vegetables here are so fresh.

00:29:08.056 --> 00:29:09.896
They must grow them themselves for sure.

00:29:13.256 --> 00:29:14.176
Ew!

00:29:14.816 --> 00:29:16.576
But there are no tomatoes.

00:29:17.816 --> 00:29:18.896
Senior, do you know?

00:29:19.456 --> 00:29:22.816
In foreign countries, tomatoes are very sweet.

00:29:23.096 --> 00:29:25.576
Abroad, they're considered fruit.

00:29:26.096 --> 00:29:30.256
But I don't know why when they're in Thailand, the taste is sour and strange.

00:29:30.416 --> 00:29:31.856
I don't like them at all. Ew.

00:29:38.896 --> 00:29:40.736
Here, eat.

00:29:41.136 --> 00:29:43.016
I don't want it. Ew!

00:29:43.576 --> 00:29:47.376
You know, ever since I started eating solid food, I've hated tomatoes the most.

00:29:48.096 --> 00:29:51.336
Are you going to disobey my order, Junior Bodyguard?

00:29:52.336 --> 00:29:54.056
I don't want it.

00:29:54.936 --> 00:29:56.176
You have to eat.

00:29:57.096 --> 00:29:58.376
Don't disobey orders.

00:30:05.456 --> 00:30:06.456
Just this much.

00:30:07.136 --> 00:30:10.496
Chew it. Don't spit it out either.

00:30:15.936 --> 00:30:18.176
Hey, this way, this way.

00:30:18.616 --> 00:30:20.976
Then teach me how to give a massage, Senior.

00:30:21.856 --> 00:30:23.536

I was the one who brought her here.

00:32:08.044 --> 00:32:11.524
I wanted to ask her something, but now it's settled.

00:32:11.724 --> 00:32:13.484
I'm hungry.

00:32:14.004 --> 00:32:17.164
Let's go eat. Come on.

00:32:25.524 --> 00:32:28.404
Achi!

00:32:35.044 --> 00:32:38.364
Patty, wait at this table. I'll go get food for you.

00:32:38.724 --> 00:32:39.484
Okay.

00:32:40.324 --> 00:32:42.644
Where are the others sitting?

00:32:42.644 --> 00:32:44.884
I'll go sit at that table.

00:32:45.724 --> 00:32:47.324
Why do we have to sit far apart?

00:32:47.724 --> 00:32:49.004
Come sit and eat together.

00:32:49.084 --> 00:32:51.324
- But...
- No buts.

00:32:51.924 --> 00:32:53.804
It's better to sit and eat together.

00:32:53.804 --> 00:32:56.404
Patty doesn't want to sit and eat alone.

00:32:56.884 --> 00:33:00.084
Hey, Alice, come sit next to Patty.

00:33:00.084 --> 00:33:02.804
And Chama, sit next to Achi. Okay?

00:33:02.804 --> 00:33:04.044
Yes, as you wish.

00:33:05.204 --> 00:33:07.204
Then Patty, wait at the table.

00:33:07.764 --> 00:33:10.644
It's okay. Patty can take care of herself.

00:33:11.124 --> 00:33:14.724
Chama's hungry. Let's go get food.

00:33:15.204 --> 00:33:18.044
Right, me too, Chama. Let's go.

00:33:27.044 --> 00:33:28.684
Okay, okay, okay.

00:33:29.084 --> 00:33:30.004
Hello, Pin.

00:33:31.004 --> 00:33:32.764
Hello, Inspector.

00:33:33.364 --> 00:33:34.604
Let me hang up first.

00:33:36.244 --> 00:33:38.524
How are the kids doing?

00:33:38.804 --> 00:33:40.004
They're fine, Pin.

00:33:41.564 --> 00:33:42.764
What a relief.

00:33:43.324 --> 00:33:46.524
If anything happens, please help take care of them.

00:33:46.524 --> 00:33:48.804
I'll take good care of them, don't worry.

00:33:53.444 --> 00:33:54.284
Inspector Tee!

00:33:54.644 --> 00:33:57.004
How long have you been here? What are you doing here?

00:33:57.324 --> 00:34:00.964
I saw Pin standing here, so I came over to say hello.

00:34:00.964 --> 00:34:04.124
I was going to go inside to see you after finishing talking with Pin.

00:34:05.964 --> 00:34:07.004
Have you finished talking?

00:34:07.244 --> 00:34:09.484
Or should I wait inside the house?

00:34:09.684 --> 00:34:14.884
We were just casually catching up a bit, nothing much.

00:34:17.644 --> 00:34:18.484
Then let's go inside.

00:34:19.084 --> 00:34:19.724
Alright.

00:34:20.444 --> 00:34:22.004
Yes, let's go.

00:34:22.524 --> 00:34:25.564
It's hot outside. It's cool and comfortable inside.

00:34:25.564 --> 00:34:28.284
I'll have someone serve water in a moment.

00:34:28.284 --> 00:34:30.244
Thank you. Then I'll go in first.

00:34:30.244 --> 00:34:30.764
Okay.

00:34:41.044 --> 00:34:43.204
Here, here, here.

00:34:46.364 --> 00:34:47.404
Can you manage?

00:34:47.604 --> 00:34:48.644
Thank you.

00:34:49.684 --> 00:34:52.364
So you won't be hungry, you know.

00:34:56.764 --> 00:34:58.884
Try this one too.

00:35:00.284 --> 00:35:01.884
- Is it good?
- Mm-hmm.

00:35:02.644 --> 00:35:04.364
It's all over your face. Come here.

00:35:15.164 --> 00:35:15.924
Aren't you hungry?

00:35:17.164 --> 00:35:18.964
It's okay. Patty, you eat first.

00:35:20.804 --> 00:35:21.884
Achi, you can eat this.

00:35:24.044 --> 00:35:25.604
You go ahead and eat, Chama.

00:35:26.204 --> 00:35:26.964
There's plenty more.

00:35:44.204 --> 00:35:45.804
Hello, viewers.

00:35:46.004 --> 00:35:47.844
Meet Mick on today's noon news.

00:35:48.004 --> 00:35:50.764
Recently, Phirom Siwatchaponlakai,

00:35:50.764 --> 00:35:54.004
or the famous politician we know well as "the cat with nine lives,"

00:35:54.204 --> 00:35:57.484
has gone to give a statement to the police for the second time

00:35:57.484 --> 00:35:59.964
following the recent assassination attempt.

00:35:59.964 --> 00:36:02.884
Today, Phirom looks much brighter

00:36:02.884 --> 00:36:04.884
and said he's ready to answer all questions

00:36:04.884 --> 00:36:07.764
to make the police's work as smooth as possible.

00:36:16.844 --> 00:36:17.804
Where are you going?

00:36:20.404 --> 00:36:21.204
I'm bored.

00:36:21.564 --> 00:36:24.044
So I thought I'd go see Patty.

00:36:24.524 --> 00:36:27.324
Why? Let her rest.

00:36:28.244 --> 00:36:29.884
It's so boring.

00:36:29.884 --> 00:36:32.164
Sitting here with nothing to do.

00:36:32.884 --> 00:36:34.084
What are you doing, Senior?

00:36:35.364 --> 00:36:37.804
I'm checking the news.

00:36:38.284 --> 00:36:39.324
And how is it?

00:36:39.884 --> 00:36:40.924
Nothing much.

00:36:41.204 --> 00:36:43.684
Hey, are you free, Junior?

00:36:44.364 --> 00:36:45.324
Come give me a massage.

00:36:45.924 --> 00:36:49.364
My neck really hurts. I think I slept wrong last night.

00:36:50.004 --> 00:36:51.444
Is this part of the mission?

00:36:51.964 --> 00:36:52.644
Yes.

00:36:53.004 --> 00:36:54.324
I told you already,

00:36:54.524 --> 00:36:58.404
when Senior tells you to do something, Junior has to do it.

00:36:58.964 --> 00:37:00.444
But I don't know how to massage.

00:37:00.604 --> 00:37:02.164
It's not hard. Come here.

00:37:03.804 --> 00:37:06.724
Come massage me. My neck hurts so much.

00:37:11.324 --> 00:37:12.164
Okay.

00:37:13.284 --> 00:37:15.084
Hey, use more force.

00:37:15.764 --> 00:37:17.804
That's as hard as I can go.

00:37:17.804 --> 00:37:20.244
What kind of bodyguard are you? Is that all the strength you have?

00:37:21.804 --> 00:37:23.564
I don't know how to massage.

00:37:23.564 --> 00:37:24.644
This way, this way.

00:37:25.004 --> 00:37:27.404
Then teach me how, Senior.

00:37:28.884 --> 00:37:30.244
Okay, let me show you.

00:37:34.604 --> 00:37:37.204
Come on, Senior, I'm ready to learn.

00:37:38.364 --> 00:37:41.324
Look, when you massage, you have to do it like this.

00:37:41.684 --> 00:37:43.444
Put some force into it.

00:37:43.444 --> 00:37:45.924
What about the arms, Senior?

00:37:46.404 --> 00:37:48.284
Come on, how hard can it be? Look.

00:37:50.884 --> 00:37:51.564
How's that?

00:37:52.484 --> 00:37:55.684
When you massage, you have to do it like this. Then I'll feel less tired.

00:37:56.004 --> 00:37:57.764
Oh, what if...

00:37:58.724 --> 00:38:02.084
Senior gets a headache? How do I massage that?

00:38:02.324 --> 00:38:03.804
- Here, right?
- Yes, yes.

00:38:04.084 --> 00:38:06.444
Look, just massage like this.

00:38:07.804 --> 00:38:08.524
How's that?

00:38:08.804 --> 00:38:11.484
Hey Senior, can you do my back a bit more?

00:38:12.044 --> 00:38:13.924
Hey, that's not right.

00:38:14.964 --> 00:38:17.804
I'm here to teach you how to massage, for you to massage me.

00:38:19.004 --> 00:38:20.004
I was really enjoying it.

00:38:22.164 --> 00:38:23.524
Go, go, go.

00:38:57.804 --> 00:38:58.684
Where are you going?

00:38:58.804 --> 00:38:59.444
Shh...

00:39:00.084 --> 00:39:01.524
P'Natee, are you sure

00:39:02.044 --> 00:39:04.644
that no one knows we're staying here?

00:39:15.684 --> 00:39:17.884
How much longer do I have to endure this?

00:39:17.884 --> 00:39:19.884
I'm starting to not be able to take it anymore.

00:39:20.764 --> 00:39:22.364
Please be patient.

00:39:24.004 --> 00:39:24.724
Alice!
