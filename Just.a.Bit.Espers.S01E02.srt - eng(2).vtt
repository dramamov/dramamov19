00:00:36.141 --> 00:00:37.433
Good morning.

00:00:39.227 --> 00:00:40.145
You're in the way.

00:00:40.645 --> 00:00:41.771
Sorry.

00:00:53.283 --> 00:00:55.493
Can I help you with something?

00:01:00.165 --> 00:01:02.500
-Bunty.
-Yes?

00:01:05.837 --> 00:01:07.672
Why are you sleeping
on the edge of the bed?

00:01:07.755 --> 00:01:09.632
You fell from the bed last night too.

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:15.805
But I'm still sleeping well,
even if it's on the edge.

00:01:22.687 --> 00:01:27.442
Listen to me. We're husband and wife.

00:01:29.986 --> 00:01:31.237
You're right…

00:01:53.843 --> 00:01:56.804
Don't forget to take one once a week.

00:01:57.805 --> 00:02:01.768
A pill that gives superpowers.
It is truly amazing.

00:02:02.435 --> 00:02:03.853
And the patents and approval?

00:02:05.939 --> 00:02:07.607
Is it classified as a supplement?

00:02:09.692 --> 00:02:12.070
It's not exactly a pill
that gives you superpowers.

00:02:13.947 --> 00:02:16.950
The power that manifests
depends on the individual.

00:02:17.659 --> 00:02:20.119
That's why you are called "Espers."

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:24.749
We refer to it

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:27.877
as Extra-Sensory Perception.

00:02:29.045 --> 00:02:30.672
In your case,

00:02:30.755 --> 00:02:33.383
you can read people's minds
just by touching them, right?

00:02:34.008 --> 00:02:35.134
Yes.

00:02:35.969 --> 00:02:38.096
You're the most

00:02:38.179 --> 00:02:40.598
supernatural Esper I know.

00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:44.894
And regarding the missions…

00:02:44.978 --> 00:02:46.187
What is it?

00:02:46.271 --> 00:02:49.983
It's about the details
of the feedback I received.

00:02:51.609 --> 00:02:55.154
Mr. Suzuki paid off his debts
because I made him carry his umbrella.

00:02:55.905 --> 00:02:59.617
Mr. Sato was promoted because
I set his alarm five minutes ahead.

00:03:00.284 --> 00:03:03.830
Mr. Takahashi could get married
because I drained his phone battery.

00:03:04.539 --> 00:03:07.458
How does this actually work?

00:03:09.335 --> 00:03:11.879
That's a natural question to ask

00:03:12.380 --> 00:03:13.840
for someone as talented as you.

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:17.176
First, Mr. Suzuki met a millionaire

00:03:17.802 --> 00:03:20.179
who had lost
his walking stick that evening.

00:03:20.972 --> 00:03:22.974
He lent him his umbrella
to use as a walking stick,

00:03:23.057 --> 00:03:27.520
and in return, he received a lot of money,
which he'll use to repay his debt.

00:03:29.731 --> 00:03:32.442
By waking up five minutes earlier,

00:03:33.067 --> 00:03:36.779
Mr. Sato arrived at work on time that day
and met the area manager.

00:03:37.572 --> 00:03:41.326
Had he been late,
he wouldn't have been promoted.

00:03:41.993 --> 00:03:42.869
Okay…

00:03:42.952 --> 00:03:45.997
Mr. Takahashi was going to meet someone
he found on a dating app.

00:03:46.789 --> 00:03:50.710
But he wasn't able to do so
because his phone had no battery.

00:03:51.669 --> 00:03:55.381
That person wasn't his soulmate.

00:03:58.509 --> 00:04:00.595
You already know what happens next, right?

00:04:02.930 --> 00:04:07.685
He will meet his soulmate
after that and get married?

00:04:08.436 --> 00:04:10.730
Exactly. You catch on quickly!

00:04:10.813 --> 00:04:15.568
But all of those things are supposed
to happen in the future, right?

00:04:17.028 --> 00:04:18.112
And they will happen.

00:04:20.239 --> 00:04:22.909
That's a natural question to ask

00:04:24.118 --> 00:04:25.453
for someone as talented as you.

00:04:28.664 --> 00:04:30.833
The world we live in…

00:04:31.584 --> 00:04:34.253
You can think of it

00:04:35.421 --> 00:04:37.382
as a tree-like structure.

00:04:38.633 --> 00:04:39.467
A tree?

00:04:40.385 --> 00:04:43.721
Just like a tree trunk has many branches,

00:04:44.263 --> 00:04:46.432
the world has many points of divergence.

00:04:47.975 --> 00:04:50.228
An event somewhere

00:04:50.311 --> 00:04:52.313
can trigger another event,

00:04:53.815 --> 00:04:55.358
giving rise to new futures.

00:04:56.484 --> 00:04:58.778
Events that appear unrelated at first

00:04:58.861 --> 00:05:00.696
can have effects in other places.

00:05:01.906 --> 00:05:04.158
Even a tiny bee

00:05:05.034 --> 00:05:08.579
can change the fate of the Earth.

00:05:09.747 --> 00:05:12.583
Let's help shape a better world
through our missions.

00:05:14.502 --> 00:05:15.461
Yes.

00:05:18.756 --> 00:05:20.216
How's the company housing?

00:05:21.384 --> 00:05:22.468
Well…

00:05:23.469 --> 00:05:25.012
Is there something wrong with Shiki?

00:05:27.974 --> 00:05:31.352
She's not a Nonamare employee, right?

00:05:31.936 --> 00:05:32.770
That's correct.

00:05:32.854 --> 00:05:34.814
She works at a laundromat.

00:05:36.732 --> 00:05:39.068
Due to certain circumstances,

00:05:39.652 --> 00:05:41.612
Shiki is staying in our company housing.

00:05:41.696 --> 00:05:43.614
If it were just living with her,
that'd be fine,

00:05:44.323 --> 00:05:46.409
but this morning,
she was upset with me again

00:05:46.492 --> 00:05:49.745
for sleeping on the edge of the bed.

00:05:51.205 --> 00:05:54.167
We just met six days ago.

00:05:54.917 --> 00:05:57.503
I can't believe how completely
she gets into character.

00:05:57.587 --> 00:05:58.504
It's at the point

00:05:59.547 --> 00:06:01.465
where she genuinely

00:06:01.549 --> 00:06:04.886
believes I'm her husband.

00:06:06.846 --> 00:06:08.764
Mrs. Enjaku said…

00:06:08.848 --> 00:06:10.558
It's not an act.

00:06:10.641 --> 00:06:13.728
Just go along with what she says.
That's part of the job too.

00:06:15.104 --> 00:06:16.647
What did she mean by that?

00:06:18.316 --> 00:06:19.567
Does Shiki

00:06:19.650 --> 00:06:22.403
actually…

00:06:25.323 --> 00:06:26.574
I love you.

00:06:29.827 --> 00:06:30.870
Love you?

00:06:33.331 --> 00:06:34.749
She loves you.

00:06:37.877 --> 00:06:40.004
No… That's not possible.

00:06:40.087 --> 00:06:41.172
It could be.

00:06:46.219 --> 00:06:48.596
Anyway, you shouldn't worry about it.

00:06:49.597 --> 00:06:51.807
You just need to keep acting
as her husband,

00:06:51.891 --> 00:06:54.060
behave like a regular office worker,

00:06:54.143 --> 00:06:55.478
and save the world.

00:06:57.605 --> 00:06:59.899
Well then, keep up the good work.

00:07:03.152 --> 00:07:05.446
TAKKOBI

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:19.961
MISSION 57

00:07:20.753 --> 00:07:22.505
Bunty, let's go somewhere today.

00:07:23.589 --> 00:07:25.800
Sorry, I have to work.

00:07:27.176 --> 00:07:28.261
I see…

00:07:30.096 --> 00:07:33.015
Well, I guess
I'll work on my glutes, then.

00:07:33.975 --> 00:07:36.727
They say muscles never betray you.

00:07:39.313 --> 00:07:41.774
I'm not implying
that you'd betray me, Bunty.

00:07:44.527 --> 00:07:48.406
Dun dun dun, dah-glute!

00:07:48.990 --> 00:07:52.368
Dun dun dun, dah-glute!

00:07:54.954 --> 00:07:56.747
MAMORU SENDA

00:07:56.831 --> 00:07:58.416
Mission 57.

00:07:58.499 --> 00:08:01.544
Stop Mamoru Senda
from reaching his destination.

00:08:01.627 --> 00:08:03.212
That's a pretty eccentric nameplate.

00:08:04.338 --> 00:08:05.298
Bunta!

00:08:06.299 --> 00:08:08.426
-Good day.
-Good day.

00:08:08.509 --> 00:08:10.011
-Are we on the same mission?
-Yes.

00:08:11.637 --> 00:08:14.181
We need to stop him
from reaching his destination,

00:08:14.265 --> 00:08:16.392
-but where is the destination?
-Who knows.

00:08:17.685 --> 00:08:19.895
Mission details are always like this.

00:08:20.438 --> 00:08:22.690
The essential details are missing.

00:08:23.524 --> 00:08:24.775
Good morning!

00:08:24.859 --> 00:08:26.360
-Good morning.
-Good morning.

00:08:27.194 --> 00:08:29.071
Senmaru is an artist.

00:08:29.155 --> 00:08:30.448
Senmaru?

00:08:30.531 --> 00:08:32.992
A nickname for Mamoru Senda.

00:08:33.743 --> 00:08:37.288
-How do you know?
-The local community's info network.

00:08:37.371 --> 00:08:40.291
This is Senmaru's house,
which serves as his art studio,

00:08:40.374 --> 00:08:42.043
and he also teaches painting here.

00:08:42.126 --> 00:08:42.960
I see…

00:08:43.044 --> 00:08:45.379
By the way, where's his destination?

00:08:45.463 --> 00:08:46.672
-I don't know.
-Really?

00:08:46.756 --> 00:08:47.882
She doesn't know either.

00:08:50.635 --> 00:08:51.802
Come here!

00:09:03.981 --> 00:09:05.149
I guess he's going to paint.

00:09:06.067 --> 00:09:08.486
And we're saving the world
by stopping him from painting?

00:09:08.569 --> 00:09:09.570
How exactly is this setup?

00:09:09.654 --> 00:09:11.822
-Stop calling it a setup.
-Let's go!

00:09:12.490 --> 00:09:13.491
Where?

00:09:13.574 --> 00:09:15.409
-A shortcut!
-A shortcut?

00:09:16.035 --> 00:09:18.954
Wait! This looks scary!

00:09:22.166 --> 00:09:24.251
-How did it go?
-Perfectly.

00:09:24.919 --> 00:09:26.462
-What do you mean?
-That.

00:09:26.545 --> 00:09:28.798
That red car over there is Senmaru's.

00:09:28.881 --> 00:09:31.342
If he's got no car,
he can't go anywhere, right?

00:09:31.425 --> 00:09:32.885
He can use the train.

00:09:32.968 --> 00:09:35.096
Senmaru hates trains.

00:09:35.805 --> 00:09:38.099
Just to be sure, what did you do?

00:09:38.933 --> 00:09:41.602
They'd accuse me of a crime
if I punctured the tire…

00:09:44.146 --> 00:09:45.940
so, I took this!

00:09:46.023 --> 00:09:48.109
The bumper? Stealing that is a crime too!

00:09:49.443 --> 00:09:50.986
It'll be fine if I return it later.

00:09:51.070 --> 00:09:52.822
If returning things solved everything,

00:09:52.905 --> 00:09:54.073
-we wouldn't need the police.
-Hide!

00:09:54.156 --> 00:09:55.658
Go… Go…!

00:09:58.869 --> 00:10:00.705
He hasn't realized the bumper is gone.

00:10:01.330 --> 00:10:02.873
The car can still run without it.

00:10:02.957 --> 00:10:04.667
But it's a traffic violation.

00:10:05.334 --> 00:10:07.670
Ohsuke! Go tell him it fell! Quick!

00:10:07.753 --> 00:10:08.796
Go…!

00:10:08.879 --> 00:10:10.339
Wait…! Wait…!

00:10:10.423 --> 00:10:13.384
Hey! This fell from your car!

00:10:13.467 --> 00:10:14.844
Hey!

00:10:14.927 --> 00:10:16.637
We shouldn't have asked Ohsuke to do this.

00:10:16.721 --> 00:10:18.639
I thought he could handle it.

00:10:18.723 --> 00:10:20.015
Want me to fix it?

00:10:21.767 --> 00:10:23.060
-W-Will you?
-Yes!

00:10:23.144 --> 00:10:24.395
Can you back your car in?

00:10:24.478 --> 00:10:25.688
Y-Yes.

00:10:25.771 --> 00:10:27.273
Let's call a taxi.

00:10:27.356 --> 00:10:29.275
We can then ask them
to follow the red car.

00:10:30.609 --> 00:10:31.777
Are you serious?

00:10:32.778 --> 00:10:35.030
Shiki is not working today!

00:10:35.114 --> 00:10:36.157
-Yes, let's call her.
-Huh?

00:10:37.742 --> 00:10:38.617
KOBAYASHI LAUNDRY

00:10:39.243 --> 00:10:40.119
I'm here!

00:10:40.202 --> 00:10:42.329
I'm glad we can borrow the van!

00:10:42.413 --> 00:10:45.291
-Sorry for calling you all of a sudden!
-It's fine.

00:10:45.875 --> 00:10:46.667
How's work going?

00:10:49.128 --> 00:10:51.505
We're handymen, aren't we?

00:10:51.589 --> 00:10:52.757
Since the client canceled

00:10:52.840 --> 00:10:55.593
at the last minute,
we decided to go for a drive.

00:10:55.676 --> 00:10:57.762
-Right, right.
-A drive, all together.

00:10:57.845 --> 00:10:58.679
That's true.

00:10:58.763 --> 00:11:00.598
Since I was free, it was perfect timing.

00:11:00.681 --> 00:11:01.849
Where are you going?

00:11:02.892 --> 00:11:04.310
-Where?
-Where?

00:11:04.393 --> 00:11:06.353
-Where should we go?
-Where are we going?

00:11:06.937 --> 00:11:08.814
-Where to go?
-I wasn't thinking about that.

00:11:08.898 --> 00:11:10.649
-Where to go?
-Where?

00:11:10.733 --> 00:11:13.235
Yes, I'm afraid I'll be running late.

00:11:14.695 --> 00:11:17.281
Golf? I see. I'm glad to hear that.

00:11:17.364 --> 00:11:21.368
I'll contact you as soon as I arrive
at Togendai Port on Lake Ashi.

00:11:22.077 --> 00:11:23.162
Perfect.

00:11:24.705 --> 00:11:25.664
It's done!

00:11:26.290 --> 00:11:27.583
-Thank you!
-I put it on tight.

00:11:27.666 --> 00:11:28.501
Thank you.

00:11:28.584 --> 00:11:30.669
What about Enoshima? I want to go there!

00:11:30.753 --> 00:11:32.379
-Enoshima?
-Yeah.

00:11:32.463 --> 00:11:34.298
-Lake Ashi!
-Lake Ashi?

00:11:34.381 --> 00:11:35.633
-Lake Ashi!
-To Lake Ashi!

00:11:35.716 --> 00:11:36.759
-Let's go to Lake Ashi!
-Great idea!

00:11:36.842 --> 00:11:38.052
-To Lake Ashi!
-Let's go!

00:11:38.135 --> 00:11:39.512
-Lake Ashi!
-Get in the van!

00:11:39.595 --> 00:11:41.388
Let's go to Lake Ashi, Shiki!

00:11:41.472 --> 00:11:42.973
-Get in the van!
-Shiki! Quick!

00:11:43.057 --> 00:11:44.600
Driver…

00:11:44.683 --> 00:11:47.686
-Please follow that red car.
-You were not joking, were you?

00:11:47.770 --> 00:11:49.063
That red car?

00:11:49.146 --> 00:11:50.272
Yeah.

00:11:55.319 --> 00:11:56.654
KOBAYASHI LAUNDRY

00:12:02.117 --> 00:12:03.702
-Bunty.
-Yes?

00:12:03.786 --> 00:12:05.037
No, wait.

00:12:06.789 --> 00:12:07.957
Dear customer.

00:12:10.543 --> 00:12:12.670
I've been a driver for 20 years,

00:12:12.753 --> 00:12:14.046
so I'll manage to keep up.

00:12:15.756 --> 00:12:16.882
Yes, please!

00:12:41.699 --> 00:12:43.284
Mission 57.

00:12:43.367 --> 00:12:46.161
Stop Mamoru Senda
from reaching his destination.

00:12:49.248 --> 00:12:51.625
So, what did the person
in the car ahead do?

00:12:52.459 --> 00:12:53.752
Huh?

00:12:53.836 --> 00:12:55.045
It's work-related, isn't it?

00:12:55.129 --> 00:12:57.131
Are you investigating him?

00:12:57.214 --> 00:12:59.425
I didn't know that handymen
did detective work too.

00:12:59.508 --> 00:13:02.720
-Yeah, something like that…
-Is he a marriage swindler?

00:13:02.803 --> 00:13:04.930
I thought he looked like one!

00:13:05.014 --> 00:13:06.056
Actually,

00:13:06.140 --> 00:13:09.226
we were asked to stop that person
from reaching Lake Ashi.

00:13:09.310 --> 00:13:10.311
-Hey!
-Bunta!

00:13:10.394 --> 00:13:12.271
It'll be faster if we just tell her.

00:13:12.354 --> 00:13:16.025
Stop him? Shall we hit him from behind?

00:13:18.402 --> 00:13:20.404
I'm joking.
This is the van from my workplace.

00:13:20.487 --> 00:13:22.531
-You sounded like you'd do it.
-Did I?

00:13:23.574 --> 00:13:24.658
Hum!

00:13:27.077 --> 00:13:28.829
If we keep tailing him,

00:13:28.912 --> 00:13:31.624
we'll just get to Lake Ashi together,
won't we?

00:13:31.707 --> 00:13:33.375
You're right.

00:13:33.459 --> 00:13:34.793
Should I bloom some flowers?

00:13:34.877 --> 00:13:37.338
-Where?
-It doesn't matter. It'd change nothing.

00:13:37.421 --> 00:13:38.505
Hum!

00:13:40.674 --> 00:13:42.509
What was your Esper power again?

00:13:42.593 --> 00:13:44.094
Right, you haven't told us yet.

00:13:44.178 --> 00:13:47.056
I don't know yours
or Mrs. Enjaku's either.

00:13:47.139 --> 00:13:49.350
Have some tea, you boys!

00:13:49.433 --> 00:13:50.726
One for each!

00:13:50.809 --> 00:13:52.895
-Thank you.
-Tell me. I showed you mine.

00:13:52.978 --> 00:13:55.272
Stop acting like a pushy salesman.

00:13:55.356 --> 00:13:57.816
Cheap. This guy's so cheap.

00:13:57.900 --> 00:14:00.778
Shiki, you'd be better off
if you divorced him.

00:14:00.861 --> 00:14:01.904
Bunty, what did you do?

00:14:01.987 --> 00:14:03.530
I didn't do anything.

00:14:04.573 --> 00:14:06.033
We're not married.

00:14:06.116 --> 00:14:07.826
-It's just an act.
-Hum!

00:14:07.910 --> 00:14:10.162
Mrs. Enjaku, what are you exactly doing?

00:14:10.245 --> 00:14:11.413
Microwaving.

00:14:13.874 --> 00:14:15.542
Microwaving?

00:14:16.293 --> 00:14:17.670
Are her hands like a microwave?

00:14:17.753 --> 00:14:20.756
Mrs. Enjaku is an Esper
who warms things up with a "Hum!".

00:14:20.839 --> 00:14:22.341
Ding!

00:14:24.301 --> 00:14:26.553
Have this.

00:14:27.346 --> 00:14:28.514
Thank you.

00:14:35.020 --> 00:14:38.774
It's not like it isn't hot…

00:14:39.358 --> 00:14:41.527
It's subtle.

00:14:41.610 --> 00:14:43.278
Just a bit.

00:14:43.779 --> 00:14:47.074
Thanks to that,
Shiki thinks it's her special skill.

00:14:47.157 --> 00:14:48.492
She's the hand-hovering type.

00:14:49.368 --> 00:14:50.369
Hum!

00:14:51.870 --> 00:14:53.914
Hum!

00:14:58.460 --> 00:14:59.837
That's it!

00:14:59.920 --> 00:15:02.214
What's the range of her hand-based powers?

00:15:03.048 --> 00:15:05.634
If she can reach far enough,

00:15:05.718 --> 00:15:10.222
she could heat up Senmaru's car…
No, that'd be pointless.

00:15:10.806 --> 00:15:13.517
His body! She could heat up his body!

00:15:13.600 --> 00:15:15.602
-What do you mean?
-Mrs. Enjaku…

00:15:19.440 --> 00:15:21.650
-But…
-Let's give it a try!

00:15:22.443 --> 00:15:25.696
Shiki, get as close as possible
to the red car.

00:15:25.779 --> 00:15:27.865
But don't hit it from behind!

00:15:27.948 --> 00:15:29.033
Yes, sir!

00:15:32.619 --> 00:15:34.788
Things are getting exciting!

00:15:38.167 --> 00:15:39.918
Hum!

00:15:40.002 --> 00:15:42.379
-By his body?
-What part is she going to heat up?

00:15:42.463 --> 00:15:43.505
His bladder.

00:15:43.589 --> 00:15:44.798
Hum!

00:15:44.882 --> 00:15:48.969
When blood flow to the bladder increases,
the kidneys filter blood more actively,

00:15:49.053 --> 00:15:50.763
and that makes you urinate.

00:15:50.846 --> 00:15:52.931
And if he needs to go to the bathroom…

00:15:53.015 --> 00:15:54.016
He'll stop the car.

00:15:54.099 --> 00:15:57.061
Hum! Hum!

00:16:10.199 --> 00:16:12.367
-Mrs. Enjaku…
-I'm doing it!

00:16:15.037 --> 00:16:18.540
I think you're heating the wrong bladder.

00:16:19.458 --> 00:16:20.626
I need to go to the bathroom!

00:16:20.709 --> 00:16:22.169
‎-What?
‎-What?

00:16:22.252 --> 00:16:23.587
Shiki, stop the van.

00:16:23.670 --> 00:16:25.506
-Should I?
-Are you okay?

00:16:25.589 --> 00:16:27.049
Please stop that!

00:16:27.132 --> 00:16:28.425
If we stop now, we'll lose Senmaru.

00:16:28.509 --> 00:16:29.927
-Bathroom!
-Just hold it.

00:16:30.010 --> 00:16:30.886
I can't!

00:16:30.969 --> 00:16:31.970
It won't fit in that!

00:16:32.054 --> 00:16:33.347
He's signaling.

00:16:33.430 --> 00:16:36.391
Look, a service area, Bunta!

00:16:37.684 --> 00:16:39.853
Did the waves really reach Senmaru?

00:16:39.937 --> 00:16:42.106
Just luck. Her powers
are below 200 watts, you know.

00:17:15.222 --> 00:17:17.766
Three million yen. Is it really worth it?

00:17:18.392 --> 00:17:20.978
Careful! There's a huge bug on your back!

00:17:24.398 --> 00:17:26.733
A big bug was going to bite you.

00:17:27.484 --> 00:17:30.237
-Oh, thank you.
-I'm just glad you're fine.

00:17:39.079 --> 00:17:41.540
What is with the three million yen?

00:17:42.457 --> 00:17:44.418
That's what Senmaru said.

00:17:45.544 --> 00:17:46.837
Did you talk with him?

00:17:46.920 --> 00:17:50.048
Not directly.
He was more likely talking to himself.

00:17:50.674 --> 00:17:54.094
He said, "Three million yen.
Is it really worth it?"

00:17:55.179 --> 00:17:56.930
Hello. This is Senda.

00:17:57.014 --> 00:17:59.183
I ran into a problem
just as I was about to leave.

00:18:01.518 --> 00:18:04.188
The painting is fine. I finished it.

00:18:05.939 --> 00:18:08.233
So, he's not going to paint,

00:18:08.317 --> 00:18:09.902
but he's going to sell a painting?

00:18:11.236 --> 00:18:12.571
Is he a famous painter?

00:18:12.654 --> 00:18:14.239
Not at all.

00:18:14.323 --> 00:18:17.659
He makes a living teaching art classes
and painting posters or signs

00:18:17.743 --> 00:18:20.370
-people in the neighborhood ask for.
-I see.

00:18:20.454 --> 00:18:22.289
But he's getting three million yen?

00:18:22.372 --> 00:18:23.749
Bunty!

00:18:24.750 --> 00:18:27.169
-I got you the one you like!
-That looks good.

00:18:27.252 --> 00:18:29.546
-Here, Mrs. Enjaku.
-Thanks!

00:18:29.630 --> 00:18:31.715
I don't really like potato mochi, though…

00:18:31.798 --> 00:18:32.925
Huh?

00:18:34.259 --> 00:18:36.011
You really like them, don't you?

00:18:36.094 --> 00:18:37.971
Bunta…

00:18:38.055 --> 00:18:40.682
I told you to go along
with Shiki, you idiot!

00:18:42.726 --> 00:18:44.311
I love them. I really do.

00:18:44.895 --> 00:18:45.854
-I knew it.
-Yes.

00:18:45.938 --> 00:18:48.398
Be careful, you idiot!

00:18:49.942 --> 00:18:50.817
Sorry.

00:18:51.401 --> 00:18:52.611
Where's the ketchup and mustard…?

00:18:54.238 --> 00:18:55.280
He's leaving!

00:18:57.032 --> 00:18:59.326
So, I can read their minds
when they touch me too.

00:19:01.203 --> 00:19:04.164
It's really hot.
You guys should drink water.

00:19:04.248 --> 00:19:05.415
Hanzo!

00:19:07.084 --> 00:19:08.377
We're leaving!

00:19:13.465 --> 00:19:14.466
‎Hurry up.

00:19:15.050 --> 00:19:16.426
-Your potato mochi!
-Thanks!

00:19:16.510 --> 00:19:18.595
-Quick, Shiki!
-Let's go!

00:19:19.346 --> 00:19:21.056
‎Sorry, please make space!

00:19:22.057 --> 00:19:23.392
Should I keep tailing him?

00:19:23.475 --> 00:19:24.935
Yes, please.

00:19:25.018 --> 00:19:27.562
At this rate, we'll reach Lake Ashi.

00:19:27.646 --> 00:19:30.023
Don't worry.
It's all about timing from here.

00:19:30.649 --> 00:19:31.692
Timing?

00:19:39.700 --> 00:19:41.910
We'll arrive at Lake Ashi soon.

00:19:41.994 --> 00:19:44.037
Don't rush things.

00:19:45.706 --> 00:19:48.875
By the way, do you all actually believe

00:19:48.959 --> 00:19:50.794
that we're saving the world

00:19:50.877 --> 00:19:53.005
by completing these missions?

00:19:53.088 --> 00:19:54.756
Bunta…

00:19:54.840 --> 00:19:57.009
Why are you asking me that?
Are you quitting?

00:19:57.718 --> 00:19:59.553
No, a job's a job.

00:20:01.763 --> 00:20:04.099
We're almost there.

00:20:08.228 --> 00:20:09.479
They're here.

00:20:47.017 --> 00:20:48.185
He's stopping.

00:20:57.235 --> 00:20:58.737
-Shiki, stop the van.
-Okay.

00:21:00.489 --> 00:21:01.323
Huh?

00:21:04.034 --> 00:21:05.243
Thank you!

00:21:13.001 --> 00:21:16.004
Do you control the animals?

00:21:16.088 --> 00:21:17.714
I don't control them.

00:21:17.798 --> 00:21:19.674
I'm an Esper who nicely asks the animals.

00:21:21.051 --> 00:21:23.345
Please, help me stop him.

00:21:25.847 --> 00:21:27.307
Don't say that. I'm begging you.

00:21:29.768 --> 00:21:31.978
Popcorn? Alright.

00:21:32.062 --> 00:21:35.273
I ask them, as a favor,
to help me just a bit.

00:21:36.149 --> 00:21:37.484
Just a bit?

00:21:37.567 --> 00:21:39.528
Hey, look!

00:21:40.320 --> 00:21:41.405
Damn it!

00:21:41.488 --> 00:21:42.406
-Let's go!
-Okay.

00:21:42.489 --> 00:21:44.116
Shiki!

00:21:44.199 --> 00:21:45.867
-Start the van!
-Go, go.

00:21:52.624 --> 00:21:54.584
Thank you. It'll be 5,800 yen.

00:21:54.668 --> 00:21:55.794
Here you are.

00:21:56.420 --> 00:21:58.004
A ropeway, huh?

00:21:58.088 --> 00:22:00.173
He said he was going to Togen something.

00:22:00.799 --> 00:22:01.633
Togendai Station.

00:22:01.716 --> 00:22:04.845
-It's the last stop.
-He's a tough one.

00:22:05.554 --> 00:22:07.389
-Let's take a picture all together!
-Huh?

00:22:07.472 --> 00:22:09.474
-Now?
-Look!

00:22:09.558 --> 00:22:11.518
-It says "Huge"!
-It is huge!

00:22:11.601 --> 00:22:12.519
Let's take it!

00:22:12.602 --> 00:22:14.354
I'm taking it.

00:22:14.438 --> 00:22:16.898
-Say "cheese!"
-Cheese!

00:22:17.649 --> 00:22:18.900
It looks good!

00:22:18.984 --> 00:22:19.860
Now you, Shiki!

00:22:19.943 --> 00:22:21.194
-Mrs. Enjaku, don't!
-Let's ask someone!

00:22:21.278 --> 00:22:22.487
Excuse me!

00:22:25.198 --> 00:22:26.366
Do you want a picture?

00:22:29.077 --> 00:22:31.746
Yes, please.

00:22:31.830 --> 00:22:33.248
How about we destroy the painting?

00:22:33.915 --> 00:22:35.750
He won't go if he's got nothing to sell.

00:22:35.834 --> 00:22:37.502
-It's worth three million yen!
-Yeah…

00:22:38.503 --> 00:22:39.671
Here I go.

00:22:39.754 --> 00:22:42.382
Say "smile"!

00:22:43.675 --> 00:22:45.969
-Thank you!
-Thanks!

00:22:46.052 --> 00:22:47.262
-Thank you very much.
-Thanks.

00:22:48.763 --> 00:22:50.974
Huh? Aren't you…?

00:22:51.933 --> 00:22:53.101
Could it be…?

00:22:53.727 --> 00:22:54.561
The bumper guy!

00:23:02.360 --> 00:23:04.237
What are you doing?

00:23:04.321 --> 00:23:05.947
There was a bug on it.

00:23:06.448 --> 00:23:08.658
You really attract bugs, don't you?

00:23:08.742 --> 00:23:10.452
This is something important!

00:23:14.497 --> 00:23:17.125
It's cute! It's an angel.

00:23:18.376 --> 00:23:19.502
Is it okay?

00:23:20.045 --> 00:23:21.755
It doesn't look scratched.

00:23:21.838 --> 00:23:23.089
Damn…

00:23:23.673 --> 00:23:26.176
Isn't this from that artist…?

00:23:26.259 --> 00:23:27.844
Paul…

00:23:27.928 --> 00:23:29.804
It's one of Paul Klee's late works.

00:23:29.888 --> 00:23:32.432
-I knew it!
-It's expensive, right?

00:23:33.725 --> 00:23:36.061
-Around 20 million yen.
-Twenty million?

00:23:36.144 --> 00:23:37.270
Twenty million!

00:23:39.481 --> 00:23:41.149
This kind of picture?

00:23:42.525 --> 00:23:43.944
It's an unpublished piece, so…

00:23:44.027 --> 00:23:47.280
That's how much
a Paul Klee painting would be worth!

00:23:49.282 --> 00:23:51.826
It's fake, though. I painted it.

00:23:54.412 --> 00:23:55.914
Thank God the picture is fine.

00:23:58.667 --> 00:24:00.252
Let's show some respect, then.

00:24:02.379 --> 00:24:03.588
Excuse me…

00:24:04.881 --> 00:24:05.966
Hey…

00:24:06.049 --> 00:24:07.550
Is he really a marriage swindler?

00:24:08.426 --> 00:24:10.887
An art scammer. He's a forger.

00:24:10.971 --> 00:24:11.930
Huh?

00:24:12.555 --> 00:24:14.349
Let's leave the car here.

00:24:14.975 --> 00:24:17.519
To reach Togendai, we'll transfer
at the next stop, Owakudani.

00:24:20.689 --> 00:24:23.650
The person waiting at Lake Ashi
is probably an art dealer.

00:24:24.401 --> 00:24:27.946
He'll buy Senmaru's
fake painting for three million yen

00:24:28.029 --> 00:24:30.073
and resell it for 20 million.

00:24:30.156 --> 00:24:32.075
Are there people who'd fall for that?

00:24:32.158 --> 00:24:33.827
A skilled forger

00:24:33.910 --> 00:24:37.080
might even use pigments
from the original period.

00:24:37.163 --> 00:24:38.790
They can forge the certificates too.

00:24:40.125 --> 00:24:43.461
I knew something was off
when he said it was a Paul Klee painting.

00:24:43.545 --> 00:24:45.839
But weren't you moved by it?

00:24:45.922 --> 00:24:48.425
When he said it was worth 20 million,
I couldn't help but wonder…

00:24:49.467 --> 00:24:52.387
If the mission is to stop
the forgeries from being sold,

00:24:52.470 --> 00:24:54.222
I guess that's like saving the world.

00:24:55.056 --> 00:24:56.474
How are we going to stop him?

00:24:56.558 --> 00:24:58.768
We're almost at the transfer station.

00:24:58.852 --> 00:25:02.230
Can you break the ropeway
with your "hum" heating powers?

00:25:02.314 --> 00:25:04.107
They're only 200 watts.

00:25:04.190 --> 00:25:05.734
Should I bloom some flowers?

00:25:05.817 --> 00:25:07.068
-Not now.
-Not now.

00:25:07.736 --> 00:25:10.030
There's nothing we can do…

00:25:10.113 --> 00:25:11.865
We're just a bit Espers, after all.

00:25:14.409 --> 00:25:15.744
I'm hungry.

00:25:17.662 --> 00:25:18.955
Sorry about that.

00:25:19.748 --> 00:25:21.624
-I'm hungry.
-I'm hungry.

00:25:21.708 --> 00:25:23.251
-Right?
-Yeah.

00:25:25.003 --> 00:25:27.213
Yes, Owakudani.

00:25:39.225 --> 00:25:40.060
Hi!

00:25:40.143 --> 00:25:41.436
-Hi!
-Hi.

00:25:41.519 --> 00:25:42.812
Have you had lunch yet?

00:25:42.896 --> 00:25:44.814
There's no place to eat around here.

00:25:44.898 --> 00:25:47.650
-Why don't you come eat with us?
-Yeah!

00:25:47.734 --> 00:25:51.154
Running into each other this many times
can't just be a coincidence!

00:25:51.780 --> 00:25:54.115
Looks like there's
a nice place to eat that way.

00:25:55.033 --> 00:25:57.077
I haven't eaten at all since this morning.

00:25:58.620 --> 00:26:00.914
When you're hungry,
your thinking gets clouded.

00:26:01.414 --> 00:26:03.708
You should eat before

00:26:03.792 --> 00:26:05.001
any major life decision.

00:26:06.127 --> 00:26:09.297
My last supper
before becoming a criminal, huh?

00:26:10.924 --> 00:26:13.259
Supper at noon, huh?

00:26:16.805 --> 00:26:18.598
Alright.

00:26:19.474 --> 00:26:21.851
-Great! Let's go!
-Let's go.

00:26:27.482 --> 00:26:29.401
Owakudani curry.

00:26:29.484 --> 00:26:31.778
-It looks yummy.
-Didn't know this restaurant was here.

00:26:31.861 --> 00:26:32.862
Really?

00:26:33.405 --> 00:26:35.490
I should've been at Togendai by now,

00:26:35.573 --> 00:26:37.659
meeting someone, but it's been

00:26:38.368 --> 00:26:40.495
one problem after another
since this morning.

00:26:41.329 --> 00:26:42.956
And right before, some pigeons…

00:26:44.624 --> 00:26:46.876
Not the best topic before eating, huh?

00:26:46.960 --> 00:26:50.130
Some really unbelievable things happened.

00:26:51.714 --> 00:26:55.218
I feel like God himself
is trying to stop me.

00:26:57.095 --> 00:26:58.888
I think things like that exist…

00:27:00.849 --> 00:27:01.724
Like angels.

00:27:04.686 --> 00:27:07.355
An angel puts their hand on your shoulder.

00:27:08.940 --> 00:27:12.777
They tell you stuff, like,
"Don't go that way. That's not right."

00:27:14.904 --> 00:27:18.158
But there are moments
when we can't hear them.

00:27:24.539 --> 00:27:26.040
There's no guarantee

00:27:27.250 --> 00:27:28.209
you'll hear them.

00:27:32.088 --> 00:27:33.465
Being alive

00:27:34.674 --> 00:27:36.259
costs money, doesn't it?

00:27:37.886 --> 00:27:40.430
It's impossible to focus only on art.

00:27:41.723 --> 00:27:43.266
Even if you want to lay down

00:27:44.017 --> 00:27:46.311
the most beautiful colors,

00:27:51.232 --> 00:27:52.400
it all gets murky.

00:28:05.079 --> 00:28:08.333
A person desperate enough to grasp
at straws will grab at them, right?

00:28:09.250 --> 00:28:11.085
Even if they're told not to go that way.

00:28:14.214 --> 00:28:15.673
They have no choice

00:28:17.634 --> 00:28:19.093
but to grasp at something.

00:28:21.095 --> 00:28:22.514
All they have are straws.

00:28:31.272 --> 00:28:32.941
Let's go eat black eggs!

00:28:33.024 --> 00:28:34.275
It seems they're a famous dish.

00:28:34.359 --> 00:28:35.652
No, I…

00:28:35.735 --> 00:28:38.029
But we came all the way here!

00:28:38.112 --> 00:28:39.864
Let's just kidnap him.

00:28:39.948 --> 00:28:41.616
Stop with the illegal stuff.

00:28:41.699 --> 00:28:43.284
I'll blossom some flowers, then.

00:28:43.368 --> 00:28:44.828
No need to.

00:28:44.911 --> 00:28:46.704
Then, what should we do?

00:28:46.788 --> 00:28:49.082
Let's persuade him
while we eat the black eggs.

00:28:52.669 --> 00:28:56.256
Eating one will add
seven years to your life.

00:28:56.339 --> 00:28:57.257
Seven years

00:28:57.340 --> 00:28:58.341
with one of these?

00:28:58.424 --> 00:28:59.509
BLACK EGGS

00:28:59.592 --> 00:29:01.219
Thank you.

00:29:07.600 --> 00:29:08.643
Senda.

00:29:10.144 --> 00:29:11.354
You're impressive.

00:29:15.316 --> 00:29:16.568
At my previous company,

00:29:17.402 --> 00:29:20.905
I embezzled money.

00:29:22.282 --> 00:29:25.618
It wasn't like I was desperate.

00:29:26.369 --> 00:29:29.706
I just padded expenses
to write off client entertaining.

00:29:31.207 --> 00:29:34.586
I thought,
"I brought in the business, so it's fine."

00:29:36.421 --> 00:29:38.131
I didn't feel guilty.

00:29:39.007 --> 00:29:42.886
I never imagined I'd become a criminal.

00:29:43.386 --> 00:29:46.055
I did it with a really casual attitude.

00:29:47.974 --> 00:29:49.017
In ten years, I embezzled

00:29:49.934 --> 00:29:50.810
three million yen.

00:29:53.938 --> 00:29:56.274
Three million yen is nothing.

00:29:56.858 --> 00:29:58.318
Practically peanuts.

00:29:58.401 --> 00:30:01.404
Three million yen isn't exactly peanuts.
It's a lot of money.

00:30:01.487 --> 00:30:03.239
It's nothing!

00:30:04.991 --> 00:30:06.868
Compared to what I lost.

00:30:09.621 --> 00:30:10.872
My life…

00:30:11.456 --> 00:30:13.082
My whole life

00:30:13.958 --> 00:30:15.460
is only worth three million yen?

00:30:17.503 --> 00:30:18.880
When I thought about it,

00:30:20.048 --> 00:30:21.466
it seemed so worthless

00:30:22.717 --> 00:30:23.718
that I started to cry.

00:30:26.554 --> 00:30:27.764
But…

00:30:27.847 --> 00:30:30.141
Senda, you understand how this works.

00:30:31.476 --> 00:30:33.436
You know what's in front of you
are just straws,

00:30:34.187 --> 00:30:36.606
that they could
drag you down if you grab them,

00:30:37.231 --> 00:30:39.108
and yet you reach for them anyway.

00:30:41.027 --> 00:30:41.986
So then,

00:30:42.946 --> 00:30:44.072
keep a hold of them!

00:30:44.155 --> 00:30:46.199
-Huh?
-Wait…!

00:30:46.282 --> 00:30:48.368
If it helps him, then it's fine!

00:30:48.451 --> 00:30:49.786
Money comes before pride.

00:30:50.787 --> 00:30:51.955
In this world,

00:30:52.038 --> 00:30:55.291
success is measured
by how much money you have.

00:30:55.917 --> 00:30:59.003
-What's wrong with wanting money?
-It's not about the money.

00:30:59.087 --> 00:31:00.880
BLACK EGGS

00:31:01.756 --> 00:31:03.132
It's not about the money.

00:31:05.259 --> 00:31:07.512
The straw I'm holding onto…

00:31:09.931 --> 00:31:11.182
is a matter of pride.

00:31:12.308 --> 00:31:13.977
It's the very value of art itself.

00:31:17.397 --> 00:31:19.565
It's been discovered that a Jean Metzinger

00:31:20.149 --> 00:31:21.734
painting displayed at the prefectural

00:31:22.235 --> 00:31:23.987
art museum was a fake.

00:31:25.363 --> 00:31:26.656
It was a painting created

00:31:26.739 --> 00:31:29.325
by a forger
who imitated the artist's style.

00:31:30.535 --> 00:31:33.496
The museum purchased it
for 67.2 million yen,

00:31:33.579 --> 00:31:35.164
and for 25 years, it was admired

00:31:35.748 --> 00:31:37.917
by hundreds of thousands of visitors

00:31:38.501 --> 00:31:40.962
as a valuable work of art.

00:31:43.381 --> 00:31:44.382
People…

00:31:45.800 --> 00:31:47.385
don't mind if it's fake.

00:31:49.053 --> 00:31:51.764
No one cares how much
of his soul the artist put into it.

00:31:53.599 --> 00:31:55.852
If it's on a museum wall

00:31:56.686 --> 00:31:57.937
and looks convincing…

00:32:02.108 --> 00:32:03.568
That's art.

00:32:05.236 --> 00:32:06.612
They call it a masterpiece.

00:32:11.284 --> 00:32:12.785
What a joke, seriously.

00:32:18.166 --> 00:32:19.208
Well,

00:32:20.209 --> 00:32:21.377
let's go to Lake Ashi.

00:32:22.462 --> 00:32:23.755
Make it to the final stop

00:32:23.838 --> 00:32:25.757
and get the job done!

00:32:25.840 --> 00:32:27.008
Bunta, what are you saying?

00:32:27.091 --> 00:32:28.259
Let's calm down, okay?

00:32:28.342 --> 00:32:30.303
I'm really calm!

00:32:30.386 --> 00:32:33.639
Honestly, so what if one more forgery
appears in the world?

00:32:33.723 --> 00:32:36.642
People who don't care about art
won't even notice.

00:32:36.726 --> 00:32:38.436
The world's full of lies anyway.

00:32:40.646 --> 00:32:44.358
Don't worry. We won't tell anyone.

00:32:47.403 --> 00:32:48.696
Make the most…

00:32:50.031 --> 00:32:51.240
of your last supper.

00:32:53.951 --> 00:32:56.162
Come on. Eat up!

00:33:18.643 --> 00:33:21.604
Was Bunta actually being serious earlier?

00:33:24.899 --> 00:33:26.609
Were you aware of the embezzlement?

00:33:26.692 --> 00:33:27.735
I didn't…

00:33:28.236 --> 00:33:29.362
I didn't either.

00:33:30.530 --> 00:33:32.490
I guess it happened a long time ago,

00:33:33.491 --> 00:33:36.160
but even though we're married,
there's so much I don't know.

00:33:49.590 --> 00:33:51.259
This has gone too far.

00:33:51.342 --> 00:33:53.886
What are we going to do?
We'll get there in two stops.

00:33:55.012 --> 00:33:56.097
What was that earlier?

00:33:56.180 --> 00:33:59.308
Were you deliberately pushing him
to make him rethink it?

00:34:00.101 --> 00:34:01.686
I was being honest.

00:34:02.270 --> 00:34:05.189
He wants revenge on the world.

00:34:05.940 --> 00:34:07.316
What's wrong with that?

00:34:07.400 --> 00:34:08.776
Aren't you forgetting our mission?

00:34:09.360 --> 00:34:10.778
Saving the world?

00:34:11.404 --> 00:34:12.572
Who cares?

00:34:13.197 --> 00:34:16.284
The world's never helped me before.

00:34:17.076 --> 00:34:18.744
This one's going too far too.

00:34:18.828 --> 00:34:20.830
-Should I bloom some flowers?
-No need to.

00:34:22.748 --> 00:34:23.791
Then,

00:34:24.542 --> 00:34:26.544
we've got no choice.

00:34:33.593 --> 00:34:34.719
This is Ubako Station.

00:34:35.344 --> 00:34:37.221
Passengers who are getting off,
please disembark.

00:34:37.722 --> 00:34:38.764
Yes, thank you.

00:34:39.515 --> 00:34:40.641
-What are you doing?
-Huh?

00:34:40.725 --> 00:34:42.310
-Stop! He's not getting off!
-Hey!

00:34:42.393 --> 00:34:43.519
-Let go of his hand!
-Bunta!

00:34:43.603 --> 00:34:44.979
-Stop!
-Don't get in my way.

00:34:46.689 --> 00:34:47.815
-Over here!
-Stop!

00:34:47.899 --> 00:34:49.901
-Let go!
-Stop!

00:34:49.984 --> 00:34:51.986
-Don't get in my way!
-A foot sweep.

00:34:54.405 --> 00:34:56.782
Why are you fighting? Please stop it.

00:34:56.866 --> 00:34:58.993
No! They are friends!
They're just messing around!

00:34:59.076 --> 00:35:01.120
We're going to Lake Ashi!

00:35:01.662 --> 00:35:03.080
Please, close the door! Let's go!

00:35:04.373 --> 00:35:05.541
Ohsuke!

00:35:08.002 --> 00:35:09.045
Quick!

00:35:15.134 --> 00:35:16.719
Are you an idiot?

00:35:23.309 --> 00:35:24.685
Lake Ashi…

00:35:31.901 --> 00:35:32.985
Senda.

00:35:35.071 --> 00:35:36.113
All the best.

00:35:37.949 --> 00:35:39.867
And go after what you want!

00:35:52.129 --> 00:35:53.297
Last stop, Togendai Station.

00:36:00.638 --> 00:36:01.639
Goodbye.

00:36:25.162 --> 00:36:26.664
To Owakudani Station!

00:36:58.529 --> 00:37:00.698
-How many did you eat so far?
-Five.

00:37:01.365 --> 00:37:03.409
That'll give you 35 more years to live.

00:37:03.492 --> 00:37:04.869
I'll live past a hundred then.

00:37:05.453 --> 00:37:06.954
What changed his mind?

00:37:08.039 --> 00:37:08.998
What do you mean?

00:37:09.081 --> 00:37:12.168
I wonder why Senmaru headed back down.

00:37:13.627 --> 00:37:15.713
Maybe he didn't want to do anything bad?

00:37:17.965 --> 00:37:19.925
I feel like Bunta knows why.

00:37:23.012 --> 00:37:26.390
Bunta, put your hand on my shoulder.

00:37:28.642 --> 00:37:30.853
You're reading my mind, aren't you?

00:37:34.774 --> 00:37:36.442
Bunta is an Esper

00:37:36.525 --> 00:37:37.860
who reads people's minds.

00:37:37.943 --> 00:37:39.945
I knew you were acting strange!

00:37:40.029 --> 00:37:41.739
That's how you dodged my foot sweep, huh?

00:37:41.822 --> 00:37:43.449
-You cheater!
-No! It's just…

00:37:43.532 --> 00:37:44.617
When I touch someone,

00:37:44.700 --> 00:37:48.329
I can read their minds a bit… Just a bit!

00:37:48.412 --> 00:37:51.540
So, what was going through Senmaru's mind?

00:37:52.500 --> 00:37:56.128
Sorry, he said he
had decided not to sell it after all.

00:37:57.213 --> 00:38:00.841
I was curious to see
how far my paintings could go,

00:38:03.177 --> 00:38:06.097
but then I discovered
something I truly want to do.

00:38:07.515 --> 00:38:09.141
And go after what you want!

00:38:11.477 --> 00:38:12.728
Black eggs…

00:38:13.813 --> 00:38:15.606
I want to paint black eggs.

00:38:20.111 --> 00:38:22.154
-Black eggs?
-Yes.

00:38:22.696 --> 00:38:25.157
He went back down because he
suddenly wanted to paint these?

00:38:25.908 --> 00:38:28.494
I'm not very good

00:38:28.577 --> 00:38:30.454
at understanding artists.

00:38:31.414 --> 00:38:33.916
Yes, an average black egg.

00:38:35.042 --> 00:38:37.878
If I got a painting like that
displayed in a museum,

00:38:40.631 --> 00:38:42.425
it'd be even more amusing than a forgery.

00:38:45.010 --> 00:38:46.512
Please, don't be mad.

00:38:47.596 --> 00:38:49.473
I just met some weird people earlier.

00:38:50.433 --> 00:38:53.102
They knew my name
and what I was about to do.

00:38:54.061 --> 00:38:55.938
I wonder if they were cops.

00:38:59.150 --> 00:39:01.861
If not, they might be…

00:39:09.660 --> 00:39:12.246
That story Shiki told earlier at lunch

00:39:12.329 --> 00:39:15.875
about the angel. It made me feel lonely.

00:39:19.295 --> 00:39:21.255
None of us realized

00:39:22.214 --> 00:39:25.593
there was an angel
tapping us on the shoulder, right?

00:39:29.346 --> 00:39:31.098
Bunta, you too.

00:39:33.100 --> 00:39:36.187
Are we all a team of failures?

00:39:38.647 --> 00:39:40.816
Looks like I joined a terrible company.

00:39:40.900 --> 00:39:42.735
That's what Nonamare's about!

00:39:46.322 --> 00:39:47.364
What about Shiki?

00:39:48.949 --> 00:39:50.409
Shiki lost

00:39:50.493 --> 00:39:52.578
her husband in an accident.

00:39:54.121 --> 00:39:55.331
Apparently, he died

00:39:55.873 --> 00:39:57.708
in a horrible way, right in front of her.

00:39:58.417 --> 00:39:59.376
Huh?

00:40:01.462 --> 00:40:02.338
Hey!

00:40:08.594 --> 00:40:10.054
She's kind of

00:40:10.679 --> 00:40:13.015
projecting her late husband onto you.

00:40:13.641 --> 00:40:15.518
Or rather, she's convinced you are him.

00:40:16.519 --> 00:40:20.064
She can't accept that her husband is gone.

00:40:21.232 --> 00:40:23.567
It shattered her.

00:40:27.446 --> 00:40:30.866
I know it sounds bad,
but it doesn't matter who it is.

00:40:30.950 --> 00:40:33.452
As long as he returns,
anyone can pass for her husband.

00:40:33.994 --> 00:40:36.664
-Anyone?
-Exactly.

00:40:36.747 --> 00:40:38.332
Her memory's a bit shaky,

00:40:39.250 --> 00:40:41.126
so if you say, "It happened like this,"

00:40:41.877 --> 00:40:43.754
she'll be like, "I guess so."

00:40:45.839 --> 00:40:47.341
Is it okay to do this?

00:40:48.467 --> 00:40:49.969
Is it really okay?

00:40:50.553 --> 00:40:52.555
She's at ease

00:40:52.638 --> 00:40:54.265
now that you came around.

00:40:54.348 --> 00:40:57.601
That's true! We're so glad that you came.

00:40:57.685 --> 00:40:59.937
As long as she's happy,
who cares if it's in her head?

00:41:02.064 --> 00:41:03.857
Even a fake husband will do.

00:41:08.028 --> 00:41:10.864
The boss is always going on
about saving the world.

00:41:12.157 --> 00:41:13.617
But honestly, like you said,

00:41:15.077 --> 00:41:17.580
I couldn't care less about the world.

00:41:18.706 --> 00:41:20.165
All my life,

00:41:20.249 --> 00:41:22.876
the world has turned its back on me.

00:41:25.629 --> 00:41:26.589
But…

00:41:27.339 --> 00:41:30.801
if it's about helping Shiki,
who's right here, I get it.

00:42:10.341 --> 00:42:12.134
Did you take many good pictures?

00:42:15.721 --> 00:42:16.722
Sit down.

00:42:27.316 --> 00:42:28.692
Smile a bit more.

00:42:38.994 --> 00:42:41.538
When I was a kid,

00:42:41.622 --> 00:42:44.541
I stole a hundred yen
from my mother's purse

00:42:45.125 --> 00:42:46.335
to buy an eraser I wanted.

00:42:48.003 --> 00:42:50.547
I'm the same as you, Bunty.

00:42:52.049 --> 00:42:53.967
Not at all.

00:42:55.135 --> 00:42:57.680
Embezzlement isn't the same

00:42:58.305 --> 00:43:01.642
as a kid stealing a hundred yen.
Not even close.

00:43:04.603 --> 00:43:06.397
I wonder

00:43:07.648 --> 00:43:09.942
if an angel's hand was on my shoulder too?

00:43:17.491 --> 00:43:20.369
Don't forget I'm by your side.

00:43:26.667 --> 00:43:27.710
Sorry…

00:43:38.887 --> 00:43:40.222
Mission 57.

00:43:40.305 --> 00:43:43.684
Mamoru Senda
will live his whole life as a painter.

00:43:43.767 --> 00:43:45.561
Does that mean he won't get arrested?

00:43:45.644 --> 00:43:46.812
Thank God!

00:43:55.654 --> 00:43:56.488
Is it good news?

00:44:00.826 --> 00:44:02.703
There's a chance we'll see

00:44:03.996 --> 00:44:06.665
paintings of black eggs
in an art museum someday.

00:44:23.849 --> 00:44:25.601
Well, let's head back.

00:44:44.870 --> 00:44:46.747
‎He's killed someone.

00:44:46.830 --> 00:44:49.833
‎A hero mustn’t have
‎more regrets than an idol has love.

00:44:49.917 --> 00:44:51.543
‎You don’t need to know who I am.

00:44:51.627 --> 00:44:53.921
‎There may be explosives in this shrine.

00:44:54.004 --> 00:44:56.381
‎Just like how Bunty is going to die…

00:44:56.465 --> 00:44:58.091
‎Run! It’s about to explode!

00:44:58.175 --> 00:44:59.092
