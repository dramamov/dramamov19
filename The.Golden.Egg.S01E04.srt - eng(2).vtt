00:00:06.845 --> 00:00:08.346
How did this happen?

00:00:09.247 --> 00:00:10.081
I'm scared.

00:00:10.648 --> 00:00:11.983
This is way too scary.

00:00:17.021 --> 00:00:20.625
This is Shoichi Kojima, age 54,
who was arrested last month.

00:00:20.692 --> 00:00:23.228
The police treated it as
a simple embezzlement,

00:00:23.294 --> 00:00:26.931
but the money is still missing
and Kojima's not saying a word.

00:00:26.998 --> 00:00:30.668
His wife and daughter insist
he would never do it.

00:00:30.735 --> 00:00:33.104
However, we discovered

00:00:33.171 --> 00:00:35.573
what we believe
is his social media account.

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:36.875
41 POSTS, 66 FOLLOWERS

00:00:36.941 --> 00:00:38.510
The first post is a year and a half ago

00:00:38.576 --> 00:00:42.046
when he met a woman in her 30's,
and had a flower-viewing date in Kyoto.

00:00:42.113 --> 00:00:45.383
They started dating, and lived
a life of luxury in a fancy apartment.

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:47.385
With the embezzled money.

00:00:47.452 --> 00:00:53.892
The Sengoku Weekly thinks
he was tricked by this Saori Shinomiya

00:00:53.958 --> 00:00:58.930
into spending the entire embezzled amount
on their relationship.

00:00:58.997 --> 00:01:00.732
Saori Shinomiya.

00:01:01.366 --> 00:01:05.236
She spent her childhood starved
of parental affection,

00:01:05.303 --> 00:01:08.606
and feels indebted to her grandmother
who took her in.

00:01:09.174 --> 00:01:12.010
She always brings flowers
to her grave every year.

00:01:12.944 --> 00:01:18.917
So we found a post on the date
of the death anniversary from last year.

00:01:18.983 --> 00:01:21.619
We used the photo to trace the location.

00:01:24.489 --> 00:01:26.925
Akutsu's been staking it out
for a few days.

00:01:26.991 --> 00:01:30.328
Today's the death anniversary,
so stay sharp until tomorrow.

00:01:30.395 --> 00:01:31.429
Good luck.

00:01:37.669 --> 00:01:38.903
You haven't slept?

00:01:40.004 --> 00:01:41.206
Nope.

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:45.109
You look kind of tired, too.

00:01:45.643 --> 00:01:47.779
I was on a stakeout
since yesterday morning.

00:01:48.413 --> 00:01:50.481
What's with all the stakeouts?

00:01:51.249 --> 00:01:52.717
So, is this okay?

00:01:53.518 --> 00:01:54.452
What do you mean?

00:01:54.519 --> 00:01:56.421
I mean, staking out a cemetery.

00:01:56.988 --> 00:01:59.991
Well, it gets a bit chilly at night.

00:02:01.025 --> 00:02:02.493
That's not what I meant.

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:04.062
Have you been cursed?

00:02:04.596 --> 00:02:06.864
I mean, I guess I can't tell yet.

00:02:07.599 --> 00:02:10.468
If something horrible happens to me
later on,

00:02:11.002 --> 00:02:13.071
I guess I'll attribute it to this.

00:02:13.671 --> 00:02:15.240
You seem fine.

00:02:18.243 --> 00:02:19.177
What's that?

00:02:19.944 --> 00:02:21.112
A protection charm.

00:02:23.047 --> 00:02:23.881
This way.

00:02:24.749 --> 00:02:26.117
Is it just the one path?

00:02:26.784 --> 00:02:28.286
I think so.

00:02:28.353 --> 00:02:30.421
You haven't missed anything?

00:02:31.155 --> 00:02:32.657
Hold on, wait here.

00:02:32.724 --> 00:02:33.791
I'll go check.

00:02:36.961 --> 00:02:38.096
We're good.

00:02:38.162 --> 00:02:40.965
It would've snapped if someone
came through.

00:02:41.532 --> 00:02:42.734
So nobody's been here.

00:02:44.068 --> 00:02:45.637
Just who are you?

00:02:46.771 --> 00:02:48.640
I learned this from Yamabuki.

00:02:49.173 --> 00:02:50.508
Yamabuki, I see.

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:53.411
Okay, let's go.

00:02:54.812 --> 00:02:55.647
What, really?

00:02:55.713 --> 00:02:56.914
Of course!

00:02:56.981 --> 00:02:59.317
Was there a grave for a Shinomiya?

00:02:59.384 --> 00:03:00.585
No, there wasn't.

00:03:02.020 --> 00:03:03.554
Probably a fake name.

00:03:04.188 --> 00:03:07.091
Although, when I saw a woman walk by,

00:03:07.158 --> 00:03:10.662
I asked about Shoichi Kojima,
and she bolted.

00:03:10.728 --> 00:03:11.863
You think it was her?

00:03:13.331 --> 00:03:14.165
Yes.

00:03:15.133 --> 00:03:16.067
So,

00:03:16.134 --> 00:03:18.770
when I followed after her,
she tripped up ahead

00:03:18.836 --> 00:03:21.139
and spilled the contents of her bag.

00:03:21.205 --> 00:03:24.842
So, that's when I picked up this key.

00:03:26.678 --> 00:03:28.313
-A cherry blossom?
-Yes.

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:33.351
Kojima's account mentions that the key
is on a cherry blossom key chain

00:03:33.418 --> 00:03:36.688
to commemorate their trip to Kyoto.

00:03:37.322 --> 00:03:40.191
Proof to tie Kojima to Shinomiya?

00:03:40.758 --> 00:03:41.592
Yes.

00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:45.029
Which is why I think Saori Shinomiya

00:03:45.763 --> 00:03:47.899
will return here to get that back.

00:03:51.469 --> 00:03:53.204
I'll pop over to the office.

00:03:53.971 --> 00:03:55.073
Already?

00:03:55.139 --> 00:03:56.441
I'll be back at 11:00 p.m.

00:03:56.507 --> 00:03:58.242
You could nap here.

00:03:58.309 --> 00:04:00.345
I want to take a shower, too.

00:04:02.480 --> 00:04:05.750
The cemetery gate is closed from 6:00 p.m.
to 8:00 a.m.

00:04:05.817 --> 00:04:09.887
So if Shinomiya is showing up,
it'll more likely be tomorrow morning.

00:04:10.455 --> 00:04:11.556
Okay.

00:04:11.622 --> 00:04:13.958
But if she does show up,

00:04:14.525 --> 00:04:18.129
you have to use that key to ask her
her connection to Kojima.

00:04:19.397 --> 00:04:23.201
I'll share this message
I received from Kitahama.

00:04:23.701 --> 00:04:26.971
"Show no mercy,
make her admit everything."

00:04:27.038 --> 00:04:28.473
That's the word.

00:04:28.539 --> 00:04:29.440
Okay.

00:04:29.507 --> 00:04:30.608
Good luck then.

00:04:52.296 --> 00:04:54.298
Ghosts don't exist.

00:04:55.733 --> 00:04:57.869
Ghosts are a lie.

00:04:58.636 --> 00:05:00.405
They're justâ€•

00:05:05.443 --> 00:05:07.445
MOM

00:05:09.113 --> 00:05:11.048
Hello, what's up?

00:05:11.582 --> 00:05:13.684
Hinako, you doing good?

00:05:14.318 --> 00:05:15.753
Yeah, I'm fine.

00:05:16.254 --> 00:05:18.322
Sorry I haven't been able to answer.

00:05:18.389 --> 00:05:20.992
It's fine if you've been busy.

00:05:21.559 --> 00:05:22.493
You at the office?

00:05:22.560 --> 00:05:24.462
No, I'm on a stakeout.

00:05:24.529 --> 00:05:25.563
Stakeout?

00:05:25.630 --> 00:05:28.900
Why would a PR magazine
need to do a stakeout?

00:05:29.767 --> 00:05:30.802
So actually,

00:05:31.335 --> 00:05:33.938
I got transferred to the Sengoku Weekly.

00:05:34.605 --> 00:05:36.140
That Sengoku Weekly?

00:05:36.707 --> 00:05:37.508
Yeah.

00:05:37.575 --> 00:05:40.344
So it's part of that job.

00:05:40.411 --> 00:05:41.379
A stakeout?

00:05:41.446 --> 00:05:45.683
Why do you have to do something
like a detective for?

00:05:45.750 --> 00:05:48.886
I felt relieved when you joined
a proper company,

00:05:48.953 --> 00:05:50.688
but a stakeout?

00:05:50.755 --> 00:05:53.958
I mean, our company publishes
the Sengoku Weekly.

00:05:54.025 --> 00:05:59.297
They should send someone
with more experience, like you see on TV.

00:05:59.363 --> 00:06:01.699
Someone with a streak of silver.

00:06:01.766 --> 00:06:04.702
I'm not really getting the metaphor.

00:06:04.769 --> 00:06:07.338
Don't you see? You're a young woman.

00:06:07.405 --> 00:06:11.008
You should turn down stakeouts
before something happens!

00:06:11.075 --> 00:06:14.078
If you want to quit,
I'll come resign for you.

00:06:15.313 --> 00:06:16.881
Wait, that would be weird.

00:06:16.948 --> 00:06:19.283
Like a resignation agent's agent.

00:06:19.350 --> 00:06:22.854
But I'd be too scared,
I'll get your dad to do it.

00:06:22.920 --> 00:06:27.291
But that would be a resignation agent's
agent's agent!

00:06:31.095 --> 00:06:31.996
Hello?

00:06:32.063 --> 00:06:33.664
I'm listening.

00:06:34.232 --> 00:06:36.801
Not sure what you're saying though.

00:06:36.868 --> 00:06:40.204
Anyway, don't do anything reckless.

00:06:40.271 --> 00:06:42.073
Yeah, got it.

00:06:42.874 --> 00:06:44.041
I'll call you again.

00:06:44.809 --> 00:06:45.643
Bye.

00:06:46.844 --> 00:06:47.678
Bye.

00:07:04.629 --> 00:07:05.563
That was close.

00:07:10.067 --> 00:07:11.802
It's me, Tsubaki.

00:07:11.869 --> 00:07:14.772
When did you get here, Daisuke?

00:07:14.839 --> 00:07:15.973
You were asleep.

00:07:17.575 --> 00:07:20.578
I waved from outside,
but you didn't react, so I got in.

00:07:21.379 --> 00:07:23.147
Wake me up then.

00:07:23.214 --> 00:07:27.485
But Yamabuki said you probably
haven't been sleeping lately.

00:07:27.552 --> 00:07:29.320
I let you sleep out of kindness.

00:07:32.423 --> 00:07:35.059
Nobody came while you were asleep.

00:07:36.127 --> 00:07:38.062
I was about to mess up again.

00:07:42.033 --> 00:07:43.100
I brought you food.

00:07:43.868 --> 00:07:45.269
Kitahama told me to.

00:07:46.837 --> 00:07:47.972
Thank you.

00:07:53.411 --> 00:07:55.179
You remember Madoka Hashimoto?

00:07:55.246 --> 00:07:57.715
What? The missing high school girl?

00:07:57.782 --> 00:07:58.516
Yeah.

00:07:58.583 --> 00:08:02.787
Of course I do, I went to find
her old workplace after all.

00:08:03.688 --> 00:08:06.857
We got a tip that someone
spotted her in Fukuoka.

00:08:06.924 --> 00:08:08.793
Huh? Was she found?

00:08:08.859 --> 00:08:10.361
No, it was fake.

00:08:11.429 --> 00:08:13.397
I went to Fukuoka with Yamabuki,

00:08:14.465 --> 00:08:16.634
and asked around the bars,

00:08:17.802 --> 00:08:21.272
but I guess I had an attitude,

00:08:21.339 --> 00:08:23.040
and pissed off some goons.

00:08:23.674 --> 00:08:27.878
I gave them my card
and said I was a reporter,

00:08:27.945 --> 00:08:32.850
but the second they saw Sengoku Weekly,
they dragged me outside by the collar.

00:08:33.818 --> 00:08:35.252
What happened?

00:08:35.319 --> 00:08:37.488
Yamabuki came in the nick of time.

00:08:37.555 --> 00:08:39.056
I'm so sorry!

00:08:39.123 --> 00:08:42.660
I apologize for my colleague's rudeness.

00:08:43.227 --> 00:08:44.562
He did?

00:08:45.162 --> 00:08:46.063
Yeah.

00:08:46.130 --> 00:08:48.265
Then he kept going at me.

00:08:50.101 --> 00:08:51.268
Don't screw me over.

00:08:52.436 --> 00:08:54.572
I told you to watch your mouth.

00:08:56.307 --> 00:08:57.274
You're useless.

00:08:59.510 --> 00:09:00.678
Just quit then!

00:09:00.745 --> 00:09:01.646
Yeah?

00:09:07.151 --> 00:09:10.955
Please let him off the hook with that.

00:09:12.857 --> 00:09:13.691
Let's go.

00:09:16.527 --> 00:09:18.496
Did he do it on purpose?

00:09:19.630 --> 00:09:21.399
Yamabuki went on to explain it.

00:09:23.401 --> 00:09:24.635
I was so scared.

00:09:24.702 --> 00:09:25.736
You okay?

00:09:26.837 --> 00:09:27.772
I'm sorry.

00:09:28.339 --> 00:09:30.041
I couldn't do anything against them.

00:09:31.442 --> 00:09:32.576
Don't worry about it.

00:09:33.210 --> 00:09:35.513
Because you seemed so helpless,

00:09:35.579 --> 00:09:37.882
someone got worried and came to tell me.

00:09:39.083 --> 00:09:42.053
If you acted brave instead,
it would've been worse.

00:09:45.189 --> 00:09:46.023
Here.

00:09:48.826 --> 00:09:53.798
Yamabuki knows how to bluff
because he's worked tabloids for years.

00:09:54.732 --> 00:09:57.635
If a rookie tries to act tough,
you get exposed.

00:09:58.736 --> 00:10:00.671
It's something to watch out for.

00:10:03.140 --> 00:10:05.409
Anyway, I thought you should know.

00:10:06.811 --> 00:10:07.845
Thank you.

00:10:08.946 --> 00:10:10.481
-Well, I'm off.
-What?

00:10:16.053 --> 00:10:16.921
Don't sleep.

00:10:16.987 --> 00:10:18.089
I won't sleep.

00:10:49.820 --> 00:10:51.655
Did Shinomiya show up?

00:10:52.590 --> 00:10:53.457
No.

00:10:53.524 --> 00:10:54.592
I see.

00:10:56.360 --> 00:10:58.429
Daisuke got these for us.

00:10:59.296 --> 00:11:00.798
You can have the rest.

00:11:00.865 --> 00:11:02.666
I'll get sleepy if I eat.

00:11:02.733 --> 00:11:03.768
Really?

00:11:03.834 --> 00:11:05.970
I get sleepy if I don't eat.

00:11:06.036 --> 00:11:07.338
Oh, nice! Rice balls!

00:11:08.806 --> 00:11:09.774
It's 2:00 a.m.

00:11:11.876 --> 00:11:12.810
Yeah.

00:11:14.879 --> 00:11:15.813
Only 4:00 a.m.

00:11:16.847 --> 00:11:17.681
Huh?

00:11:19.416 --> 00:11:20.284
What is it?

00:11:21.752 --> 00:11:23.454
Huh? Gone already?

00:11:23.521 --> 00:11:24.488
What is?

00:11:24.555 --> 00:11:26.090
-The food.
-Excuse me?

00:11:27.057 --> 00:11:29.493
-I'll go run to the store.
-What?

00:11:29.560 --> 00:11:30.895
Keep watch, okay?

00:11:32.696 --> 00:11:33.731
Thanks!

00:11:34.732 --> 00:11:35.866
Thank you!

00:11:45.910 --> 00:11:46.944
Akutsu?

00:11:49.313 --> 00:11:50.147
It's not him!

00:11:51.582 --> 00:11:52.817
Why now?

00:12:04.361 --> 00:12:05.729
There's no mistake.

00:12:05.796 --> 00:12:07.598
It's Shinomiya herself.

00:12:10.501 --> 00:12:12.970
I can't mess up this time.

00:12:24.448 --> 00:12:26.517
This lady is an evil woman

00:12:26.584 --> 00:12:30.554
who tricked a man to spend
embezzled company money.

00:12:31.555 --> 00:12:33.591
In exchange for this key,

00:12:33.657 --> 00:12:36.627
I'll get her to admit her connection
to Kojima.

00:12:43.100 --> 00:12:44.635
What, are you kidding me?

00:12:45.202 --> 00:12:47.037
She's climbing over it? Seriously?

00:12:47.104 --> 00:12:49.440
Hold on. I didn't agree to this.

00:12:49.506 --> 00:12:50.941
Do I have to climb over it, too?

00:12:51.008 --> 00:12:52.076
Will I get arrested?

00:12:58.749 --> 00:12:59.950
She did it.

00:13:00.684 --> 00:13:02.186
Wait, what do I do?

00:13:04.788 --> 00:13:05.656
Butâ€¦

00:13:07.925 --> 00:13:09.393
I have to go!

00:13:12.029 --> 00:13:13.364
How did this happen?

00:13:13.864 --> 00:13:14.732
I'm scared.

00:13:14.798 --> 00:13:16.400
This is way too scary.

00:13:16.467 --> 00:13:18.569
When I scaled the gate,

00:13:18.636 --> 00:13:21.538
I think my shirt got caught and ripped.

00:13:21.605 --> 00:13:23.540
But I can't worry about that.

00:13:31.849 --> 00:13:33.317
She's looking for the key.

00:13:34.985 --> 00:13:37.221
If I go up to her now,

00:13:37.288 --> 00:13:40.090
she'll think I'm a ghost for sure.

00:13:40.925 --> 00:13:42.459
I can't startle her.

00:13:43.160 --> 00:13:46.063
I can't get answers if she's too agitated.

00:13:48.299 --> 00:13:49.733
I should take it slow.

00:13:50.801 --> 00:13:53.537
I'll approach her
after she leaves the cemetery.

00:13:54.305 --> 00:13:57.241
FOUND SHINOMIYA
WAIT FOR ME IN FRONT OF THE GATE

00:14:03.013 --> 00:14:05.582
She's not giving up.

00:14:06.383 --> 00:14:08.018
How long will she be looking?

00:14:08.886 --> 00:14:11.388
COPY THAT, I'LL BE BACK RIGHT AWAY

00:14:32.009 --> 00:14:32.843
So cold.

00:14:33.510 --> 00:14:34.979
I'm so cold.

00:14:35.479 --> 00:14:38.282
It's so chilly where my shirt ripped.

00:14:38.349 --> 00:14:40.985
It feels like a pretty big rip.

00:14:52.129 --> 00:14:55.065
Ms. Shinomiya?

00:15:06.710 --> 00:15:09.279
I'm sorry to jump on you like this.

00:15:10.080 --> 00:15:11.415
Who are you?

00:15:11.982 --> 00:15:16.120
I'm Shinoda, a writer
for the Sengoku Weekly.

00:15:16.186 --> 00:15:17.254
A tabloid?

00:15:17.955 --> 00:15:19.256
Not the police?

00:15:20.124 --> 00:15:22.226
What are you doing here this late?

00:15:22.793 --> 00:15:23.660
What about you?

00:15:24.495 --> 00:15:27.231
Are you looking for your apartment key?

00:15:27.297 --> 00:15:31.068
The one with the cherry blossom
keychain Shoichi Kojima gave you?

00:15:31.135 --> 00:15:32.202
Give that back!

00:15:32.903 --> 00:15:35.472
Answer my questions first.

00:15:35.539 --> 00:15:37.574
What do you even want to know?

00:15:37.641 --> 00:15:43.647
You tricked Mr. Kojima, making him
embezzle company money to spend on you.

00:15:45.215 --> 00:15:47.484
I didn't do any of that.

00:15:51.422 --> 00:15:52.890
I was justâ€¦

00:15:55.225 --> 00:15:58.495
I was just modeling.

00:16:00.764 --> 00:16:01.732
Modeling?

00:16:11.375 --> 00:16:12.609
-Modeling?
-Yes.

00:16:12.676 --> 00:16:14.845
-Give me some more details.
-Yes, sir.

00:16:15.412 --> 00:16:18.916
Saori Shinomiya's maternal grandfather
is in a nursing home,

00:16:18.982 --> 00:16:21.485
and she was having trouble paying for it.

00:16:21.552 --> 00:16:26.356
Then a cousin put her in touch
with Kojima who was looking for a model.

00:16:27.024 --> 00:16:28.992
After hearing about her situation,

00:16:29.059 --> 00:16:32.196
he gave her a lump sum as a modeling fee.

00:16:32.262 --> 00:16:33.664
And the embezzlement?

00:16:33.730 --> 00:16:36.700
Shinomiya only learned about it
from the news,

00:16:36.767 --> 00:16:39.870
but she already used the money
to pay the nursing home.

00:16:39.937 --> 00:16:42.372
She thought she had to go on the run.

00:16:43.173 --> 00:16:46.210
It wasn't what we imagined at all.

00:16:49.279 --> 00:16:50.781
That's trueâ€¦

00:16:55.385 --> 00:16:57.254
LOVE PAID FOR BY BANKRUPTCY

00:16:57.321 --> 00:16:59.156
A MAN'S DREAM

00:16:59.223 --> 00:17:00.691
EXCLUSIVE INTERVIEW

00:17:01.492 --> 00:17:03.093
Is it still a scoop?

00:17:04.361 --> 00:17:06.430
-Did you record it?
-Yes I did, this time.

00:17:13.770 --> 00:17:14.605
Okay.

00:17:15.205 --> 00:17:16.473
I got it from here.

00:17:17.040 --> 00:17:18.142
Good work.

00:17:31.488 --> 00:17:32.589
SENGOKU WEEKLY

00:17:34.191 --> 00:17:36.160
So that became this.

00:17:36.860 --> 00:17:40.030
Kojima's motive wasn't anything special.

00:17:40.597 --> 00:17:44.234
He embezzled company money,
and as it grew,

00:17:44.301 --> 00:17:48.005
he used it to become a different
version of himself.

00:17:48.505 --> 00:17:51.642
To lead a completely different life,

00:17:51.708 --> 00:17:55.012
he attempted to create
a perfect social media account.

00:17:56.013 --> 00:17:59.850
To him, that meant uploading photo
sessions with Saori Shinomiya,

00:17:59.917 --> 00:18:02.886
and stage a fabricated lifestyle.

00:18:05.556 --> 00:18:09.626
Apparently he had 30 million yen
hidden in the kitchen.

00:18:10.794 --> 00:18:12.429
Looking at all that money,

00:18:13.063 --> 00:18:16.667
he hung his whole life
on being able to do anything.

00:18:17.534 --> 00:18:19.169
He's 54 years old.

00:18:19.703 --> 00:18:21.138
His life's purposeâ€¦

00:18:25.742 --> 00:18:28.045
It wasn't what I was expecting.

00:18:28.645 --> 00:18:29.680
You mean Shinomiya?

00:18:30.280 --> 00:18:32.015
It was a fake name.

00:18:32.082 --> 00:18:35.485
I just made up my mind
that she was some glitzy girl.

00:18:35.552 --> 00:18:39.223
But she was actually super normal.

00:18:39.957 --> 00:18:41.158
Normal?

00:18:42.526 --> 00:18:43.560
I meanâ€¦

00:18:45.028 --> 00:18:47.297
Not someone who should be wrapped up

00:18:47.931 --> 00:18:51.268
in a financial scandal
or hounded by tabloids.

00:18:52.269 --> 00:18:54.638
Doesn't that go for everyone?

00:18:57.174 --> 00:18:58.976
So then I thought the opposite.

00:18:59.409 --> 00:19:02.179
It could literally happen to anybody.

00:19:02.746 --> 00:19:07.251
Just one slight misstep,
and that could've been me.

00:19:12.889 --> 00:19:15.359
FUGITIVE: KOTA KUBOZUKA

00:19:15.425 --> 00:19:18.562
Like it feels far and close
at the same time.

00:19:19.329 --> 00:19:23.233
That something similar
could be happening around me.

00:19:23.834 --> 00:19:25.902
With one misaligned gear,

00:19:25.969 --> 00:19:28.238
it could be me on that side.

00:19:29.373 --> 00:19:34.611
There's a chance of getting caught up
in something and pursued by tabloids.

00:19:35.946 --> 00:19:38.215
I just kind of had that thought.

00:19:44.721 --> 00:19:46.323
TO BE CONTINUED

00:19:46.890 --> 00:19:49.359
Apparently he suddenly
pulled out of a play.

00:19:49.426 --> 00:19:50.994
Aren't you embarrassed?

00:19:51.061 --> 00:19:52.562
Buzzing around human misery.

00:19:52.629 --> 00:19:55.866
What's waiting for me at the end
of this path I've been put on?

00:19:56.500 --> 00:19:59.636
He made it into a national brand.
A young man's success story.

00:20:00.237 --> 00:20:02.306
