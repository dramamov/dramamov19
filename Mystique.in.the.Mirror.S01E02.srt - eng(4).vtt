00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:11.210
Did I see a ghost, dad?

00:00:11.210 --> 00:00:13.170
I've told you, Alan.

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:15.130
It's because you were sick.

00:00:15.130 --> 00:00:16.670
Long, shaggy hair

00:00:16.840 --> 00:00:17.840
on an unemotional face.

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:19.380
They're very familiar to me.

00:00:19.420 --> 00:00:20.340
What should I do?
กูควรทำยังไงดีวะ

00:00:20.380 --> 00:00:21.880
You should communicate with him.
มึงควรสื่อสารกับเขา

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:22.540
What did you do?

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:24.170
So I snapped and called him out,

00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:26.500
asking what he wanted
from haunting me.

00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:28.840
I told you it was a hallucination.

00:00:28.840 --> 00:00:29.420
Damn it!

00:00:29.420 --> 00:00:30.880
If that old man ghost bullshit

00:00:30.920 --> 00:00:32.460
is keeping you from moving on,

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:33.460
then you won't
ever see it again.

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:34.380
Alan!

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:35.500
You up, sleepyhead?

00:00:35.710 --> 00:00:36.710
Then this place...

00:00:36.710 --> 00:00:37.670
is a hospital?

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:39.790
Yes, the hospital of
the forgotten ones.

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:38.020
Probably the same as
the other patient here.

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:42.070
Someone brought us here

00:01:43.610 --> 00:01:44.690
and forgot that we were here.

00:01:46.900 --> 00:01:48.479
I have to go now.

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:49.820
Hey, wait!

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:50.940
Alan!

00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:51.690
Where are you going?

00:01:51.690 --> 00:01:53.940
And what's the psychiatric
hospital you mentioned?

00:01:54.729 --> 00:01:55.940
It's exactly what I meant.

00:01:56.229 --> 00:01:57.229
You're gonna get me caught, bye.

00:01:57.229 --> 00:01:58.610
Where are you going?

00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:00.650
Back to my room,
it's on the other side.

00:02:00.690 --> 00:02:01.440
See you around.

00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:02.690
Look out!

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:05.020
Alan?

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:18.940
Good morning, Alan.

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:20.900
You're up quite early.

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:28.480
Did you sleep well last night?

00:02:42.770 --> 00:02:46.650
Have you followed all of
my yesterday's instructions?

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:50.360
Yes.

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:51.730
And how are you feeling?

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:04.900
So do you feel?

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:06.150
Do you feel any better?

00:03:13.570 --> 00:03:15.900
Do you recognize me, Alan?

00:03:17.110 --> 00:03:18.270
Can you say my name?

00:03:21.070 --> 00:03:22.900
Doctor...

00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:25.440
I'm doctor Nil.

00:03:27.270 --> 00:03:29.070
Your personal doctor.

00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:31.570
And this is doctor Ophat.

00:03:33.690 --> 00:03:34.690
Okay.

00:03:35.650 --> 00:03:36.520
Alan.

00:03:36.520 --> 00:03:40.150
If you can't remember, there's
no need to force yourself.

00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:44.070
But you have to tell me, because
it's necessary that I know everything.

00:03:45.770 --> 00:03:47.520
Otherwise, you won't get better.

00:03:49.980 --> 00:03:50.650
Okay.

00:03:50.650 --> 00:03:51.650
Alright.

00:03:52.690 --> 00:03:55.070
Then you should go
get ready for the day.

00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:56.900
We'll begin the medical
check in the afternoon.

00:03:58.770 --> 00:03:59.770
Okay.

00:04:12.940 --> 00:04:14.650
Get the CT scanner prepared.

00:04:14.650 --> 00:04:15.650
Yes, doctor.

00:04:38.730 --> 00:04:40.150
Even without memory

00:04:42.400 --> 00:04:44.020
and self-control from time to time,

00:04:46.020 --> 00:04:48.270
there's still some level
of intellect left in me.

00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:52.820
I may have been brought for treatment

00:04:52.820 --> 00:04:55.020
from seeing the old
man ghost in the mirror.

00:04:59.360 --> 00:05:00.360
Remember.

00:05:00.690 --> 00:05:01.690
Remember.

00:05:01.770 --> 00:05:02.770
Remember.

00:05:03.190 --> 00:05:04.190
Remberber!

00:05:07.730 --> 00:05:09.520
I wonder if the psychological treatment

00:05:10.730 --> 00:05:12.650
would stop me from
seeing the ghost.

00:05:18.150 --> 00:05:19.610
After reading your profile,

00:05:20.440 --> 00:05:21.730
I have no doubts about it.

00:05:22.400 --> 00:05:23.770
But I'm a little curious
about something.

00:05:25.070 --> 00:05:26.360
Curious about what, doctor?

00:05:26.520 --> 00:05:27.440
Nil.

00:05:27.440 --> 00:05:30.900
Here's the profile of a new nurse who's
recently applied to work at our facility.

00:05:31.070 --> 00:05:32.360
The staff sent this over for you.

00:05:32.900 --> 00:05:34.110
He's still young.

00:05:34.690 --> 00:05:36.320
Will it be like the last time?

00:05:37.110 --> 00:05:39.820
After we hire him, perhaps
he won't stay long or will resign.

00:05:40.650 --> 00:05:42.980
I'm skeptical of
younger people like him.

00:05:45.480 --> 00:05:47.440
Doesn't hurt to give him a try.

00:05:47.770 --> 00:05:49.230
It would be a waste of time.

00:05:49.820 --> 00:05:53.150
I suggest hiring a senior
or near-retired individual.

00:05:54.900 --> 00:05:56.230
Don't give up just yet.

00:05:59.190 --> 00:06:00.610
A man a with good profile like yours

00:06:01.440 --> 00:06:04.520
could've applied for jobs
at big hospitals in the city.

00:06:06.770 --> 00:06:09.150
Why did you choose
to apply here?

00:06:11.730 --> 00:06:12.730
Honestly, doctor.

00:06:13.860 --> 00:06:15.360
I don't like crowded environments.

00:06:16.730 --> 00:06:18.570
Is it crowding that bothers you,

00:06:19.900 --> 00:06:21.480
or do you just prefer easy work?

00:06:23.150 --> 00:06:24.650
What's that supposed to mean?

00:06:26.400 --> 00:06:29.150
Many of those who
applied for job here

00:06:30.480 --> 00:06:33.610
also assumed that working in a
hospital away from the city

00:06:34.320 --> 00:06:35.690
would be simple.

00:06:37.230 --> 00:06:39.570
But after they actually
started working here,

00:06:40.820 --> 00:06:42.440
everyone of them quit.

00:06:44.900 --> 00:06:46.270
I came to this place

00:06:46.820 --> 00:06:48.650
because I want to
help other people.

00:06:50.020 --> 00:06:53.070
Do you know what
you'll be up against

00:06:54.520 --> 00:06:56.150
while working here?

00:06:58.770 --> 00:07:00.820
Your entirety of time

00:07:01.570 --> 00:07:02.980
will be spent in this place.

00:07:03.860 --> 00:07:05.940
That's the reason
why I chose this place.

00:07:06.360 --> 00:07:07.860
And I believe

00:07:07.900 --> 00:07:11.070
we should avoid using past
experiences as a baseline, doctor.

00:07:13.230 --> 00:07:14.400
What about your family?

00:07:15.440 --> 00:07:16.860
Your girlfriend?

00:07:17.690 --> 00:07:19.190
Are they truly in
agreement with this?

00:07:19.860 --> 00:07:21.770
My family said it's up to me.

00:07:22.190 --> 00:07:23.730
And I also have nothing
else to worry about.

00:07:23.940 --> 00:07:26.570
I think you should
keep your personal

00:07:26.610 --> 00:07:28.190
and work lives separate.

00:07:33.230 --> 00:07:34.230
How about this.

00:07:34.230 --> 00:07:36.020
you go ahead and interview him.

00:07:36.570 --> 00:07:37.570
I trust you since

00:07:38.150 --> 00:07:40.940
you'll be working
with him the most.

00:07:44.940 --> 00:07:46.270
Alright, Mr.Phiranthon

00:07:48.230 --> 00:07:49.440
When can you start work?

00:07:50.320 --> 00:07:51.690
Immediately,

00:07:51.690 --> 00:07:52.860
if you were to hire me.

00:07:53.650 --> 00:07:55.020
Then, follow me.

00:08:03.230 --> 00:08:04.230
Come on,

00:08:04.980 --> 00:08:06.730
I'll show you
around the hospital.

00:08:11.400 --> 00:08:13.190
Did I really land a job?

00:08:20.690 --> 00:08:21.860
Remember.

00:08:24.770 --> 00:08:26.110
Remember.

00:08:28.610 --> 00:08:30.440
Remember!

00:08:33.150 --> 00:08:34.150
Remember.

00:08:36.730 --> 00:08:37.730
Remember.

00:08:45.070 --> 00:08:46.070
Tonight,

00:08:46.650 --> 00:08:47.650
I sat in front of the mirror,

00:08:47.690 --> 00:08:49.440
waiting for the old
man's ghost to appear.

00:08:52.900 --> 00:08:55.270
I believe there's something
he wanted to tell me.

00:08:56.320 --> 00:08:57.320
Remember,

00:08:59.230 --> 00:09:00.980
find the answers.

00:09:02.360 --> 00:09:03.690
Remember.

00:09:05.230 --> 00:09:06.770
Remember?

00:09:08.480 --> 00:09:09.980
I have a question, doc.

00:09:11.070 --> 00:09:13.900
Why doesn't this place
look like a hospital?

00:09:16.400 --> 00:09:18.020
How does it not
resemble a hospital?

00:09:19.110 --> 00:09:20.400
Well, I dunno.

00:09:20.730 --> 00:09:23.020
This place seems
much too luxurious to me.

00:09:23.400 --> 00:09:24.570
Isn't it ok to be luxurious?

00:09:25.650 --> 00:09:28.190
Or are hospitals

00:09:28.190 --> 00:09:29.690
supposed to be eerie

00:09:29.730 --> 00:09:31.440
and scary all the time?

00:09:31.440 --> 00:09:32.440
No.

00:09:33.320 --> 00:09:34.360
I mean...

00:09:35.020 --> 00:09:36.190
What about you?

00:09:36.610 --> 00:09:38.270
You're not who I
thought you'd be.

00:09:38.570 --> 00:09:39.980
And how's that, doc?

00:09:44.690 --> 00:09:45.690
Huh?

00:09:50.320 --> 00:09:51.320
Wha!

00:09:54.940 --> 00:09:56.150
Have you seen Doctor Nil?

00:09:56.690 --> 00:09:57.690
Doctor Nil?

00:09:58.520 --> 00:10:00.480
Doctor Nil...

00:10:02.070 --> 00:10:03.860
Did I see him somewhere?

00:10:05.690 --> 00:10:07.650
Chill out,

00:10:07.690 --> 00:10:08.900
what's the hurry?

00:10:08.940 --> 00:10:10.270
Did you see him or not?

00:10:10.980 --> 00:10:11.980
Doctor Nil.

00:10:12.900 --> 00:10:14.480
He's probably busy
with one of his cases.

00:10:15.110 --> 00:10:15.980
Why?

00:10:15.980 --> 00:10:17.400
What did he do to you?

00:10:19.730 --> 00:10:20.730
Nothing.

00:10:21.400 --> 00:10:23.320
I just need to speak with him.

00:10:25.360 --> 00:10:27.230
You're gonna meet
him today anyway.

00:10:27.610 --> 00:10:28.940
For now, let's go get some food.

00:10:29.270 --> 00:10:30.270
I'm hungry.

00:10:36.020 --> 00:10:37.020
Come on,

00:10:37.020 --> 00:10:38.400
Your tummy's rumbling!

00:10:38.400 --> 00:10:39.400
Let's go for a lunch.

00:10:42.820 --> 00:10:44.480
You've never been
to the cafeteria, right?

00:10:46.820 --> 00:10:48.650
Follow me.

00:10:51.230 --> 00:10:52.230
I'm starving.

00:11:05.690 --> 00:11:07.570
This is a recreation room.

00:11:09.820 --> 00:11:12.860
Relaxation and
activities are held here.

00:11:21.400 --> 00:11:22.860
Greetings, Mr.Alan.

00:11:23.360 --> 00:11:24.770
Are you going for lunch?

00:11:27.440 --> 00:11:28.440
Yes, I am.

00:11:28.520 --> 00:11:29.940
Bon appétit.

00:11:31.820 --> 00:11:32.820
Thank you.

00:11:36.940 --> 00:11:38.400
How does she know my name?

00:11:39.480 --> 00:11:41.400
She knows every patient's name.

00:11:42.610 --> 00:11:44.270
It's kinda like being
in prison here, actually.

00:11:44.270 --> 00:11:46.070
They just make us
feel like we're not in it.

00:11:48.980 --> 00:11:50.770
Maybe they were
just doing their job?

00:11:51.650 --> 00:11:52.650
Nah.

00:11:53.020 --> 00:11:55.190
If they were, I wouldn't
have to climb your windows.

00:11:56.270 --> 00:11:57.900
You'll find out as time goes on.

00:12:05.520 --> 00:12:07.440
Your wristband is a
very important item.

00:12:12.570 --> 00:12:14.770
See the barcode
scanner on their hands?

00:12:15.520 --> 00:12:16.980
After scanning our wristbands,

00:12:17.360 --> 00:12:19.020
they'd know everything about us.

00:12:19.110 --> 00:12:20.440
whether they're
going to identify us

00:12:20.440 --> 00:12:21.820
or even during our mealtimes.

00:12:22.230 --> 00:12:23.730
By just scanning our wristbands,

00:12:24.190 --> 00:12:26.190
they'd know how
to prepare our food.

00:12:27.150 --> 00:12:28.610
Tofu soup again?

00:12:29.270 --> 00:12:30.270
Boring.

00:12:32.320 --> 00:12:33.860
May I have an extra
fried egg, please?

00:12:55.650 --> 00:12:57.360
Mr. Alan Bunnalai?

00:12:58.440 --> 00:12:59.440
Yes.

00:13:05.570 --> 00:13:06.570
Thank you.

00:13:21.020 --> 00:13:22.020
Remember.

00:13:22.320 --> 00:13:23.320
Come back to me.

00:13:24.820 --> 00:13:25.820
Remember!

00:13:27.610 --> 00:13:28.610
Alan.

00:13:28.820 --> 00:13:29.820
This way.

00:13:30.650 --> 00:13:31.650
Quickly!

00:13:40.520 --> 00:13:42.860
This place doesn't
look like a hospital at all.

00:13:43.980 --> 00:13:44.980
I know, right?

00:13:46.400 --> 00:13:47.610
I've had the same thought.

00:13:48.440 --> 00:13:50.320
And the patients here...

00:13:53.980 --> 00:13:55.440
they don't look like patients.

00:13:56.900 --> 00:13:58.770
Everyone seems so normal.

00:14:01.480 --> 00:14:03.610
You should eat up
before it gets cold.

00:14:12.610 --> 00:14:13.770
Can I have a look?

00:14:14.480 --> 00:14:15.480
You can't!

00:14:17.520 --> 00:14:18.820
It's my personal journal.

00:14:20.770 --> 00:14:21.770
How personal?

00:14:22.480 --> 00:14:24.020
Do you have to take
notes all the time?

00:14:26.940 --> 00:14:27.940
Mm-hmm.

00:14:30.690 --> 00:14:32.020
Dr.Nil said

00:14:32.520 --> 00:14:34.190
this is one of the treatment methods.

00:14:36.770 --> 00:14:38.440
So, you have
dementia or something?

00:14:38.860 --> 00:14:40.820
There's no such
thing as "dementia"!

00:14:44.570 --> 00:14:46.520
The term for this is
"memories issues."

00:14:48.520 --> 00:14:49.520
Really?

00:14:50.400 --> 00:14:52.400
I wanna read even more now.

00:14:53.860 --> 00:14:56.320
Can't you even grasp
what "personal" means?

00:14:57.070 --> 00:14:58.070
I do,

00:14:58.190 --> 00:14:59.690
but I just wanna
take a little peek.

00:14:59.900 --> 00:15:00.900
What?

00:15:00.940 --> 00:15:03.020
Can't friends share
their personal story?

00:15:03.190 --> 00:15:04.190
Friends?

00:15:07.650 --> 00:15:08.650
Alright.

00:15:10.150 --> 00:15:12.480
Then let me hear
your personal story first.

00:15:14.690 --> 00:15:16.480
Okay, what do you
want to know about?

00:15:17.020 --> 00:15:18.650
How about...

00:15:20.650 --> 00:15:22.520
the reason you've
been brought here.

00:15:29.320 --> 00:15:30.320
I've seen hallucinations.

00:15:33.440 --> 00:15:34.690
What kind of hallucinations?

00:15:39.820 --> 00:15:42.070
I once had a normal
life like everyone else.

00:15:45.320 --> 00:15:46.320
Until one day...

00:15:47.150 --> 00:15:49.360
my dad inherited
a piece of land.

00:15:50.730 --> 00:15:52.570
So he started a project
to build a market.

00:15:53.320 --> 00:15:56.110
Originally, that land
was a Muslim village.

00:15:56.480 --> 00:15:58.440
And there was an old cemetery

00:15:58.480 --> 00:16:00.520
where the Muslims who
once lived there were buried.

00:16:00.520 --> 00:16:02.110
My mother wasn't
happy about it at first.

00:16:02.150 --> 00:16:03.690
She didn't want to disrespect

00:16:04.270 --> 00:16:05.940
or kick them out of their homes.

00:16:06.020 --> 00:16:07.270
But my father
never listened to her.

00:16:07.730 --> 00:16:09.020
He was stubborn
and insistent about it.

00:16:09.320 --> 00:16:11.820
Then one day, I saw something

00:16:12.320 --> 00:16:13.820
I shouldn't have seen.

00:16:17.190 --> 00:16:19.110
Something you
shouldn't have seen?

00:16:21.070 --> 00:16:22.070
What did you saw?

00:16:24.020 --> 00:16:27.020
I saw dead people who'd
been buried in that cemetery.

00:16:30.270 --> 00:16:31.270
Did you...

00:16:32.730 --> 00:16:33.730
see ghosts.

00:16:34.570 --> 00:16:36.730
That also marked the
start of the entire story.

00:16:39.730 --> 00:16:42.650
I told my best friend who lived in
that village about what had happened.

00:16:42.940 --> 00:16:45.610
Because one of the
ghosts I saw was his father.

00:16:47.320 --> 00:16:49.070
The story quickly
spread after that.

00:16:49.820 --> 00:16:53.230
People had rumored that the
ancestral spirits were dissatisfied

00:16:53.480 --> 00:16:55.270
about using that
land as a market.

00:16:55.400 --> 00:16:56.900
Then a protest broke out.

00:16:57.440 --> 00:16:59.070
For my part,

00:17:00.230 --> 00:17:02.270
I was still seeing those ghosts.

00:17:04.359 --> 00:17:06.190
The funny thing was,
my dad didn't believe me.

00:17:09.190 --> 00:17:10.440
He thought I was crazy.

00:17:11.730 --> 00:17:14.270
One day, He pushed me
into the car, drove me here,

00:17:16.900 --> 00:17:18.650
and never returned
to see me again.

00:17:29.270 --> 00:17:30.270
So...

00:17:33.980 --> 00:17:36.650
Why did they bring
us to this place?

00:17:40.360 --> 00:17:42.900
Because this is the
hospital of the forgotten.

00:17:44.900 --> 00:17:46.730
Everyone who's been here

00:17:47.520 --> 00:17:48.980
was left behind by someone.

00:18:06.270 --> 00:18:07.770
Your turn to now.

00:18:19.440 --> 00:18:21.650
Try reading this journal.

00:18:30.770 --> 00:18:32.360
You saw a ghost of an old man?

00:18:33.980 --> 00:18:34.860
Yes.

00:18:40.400 --> 00:18:43.110
I usually see him
when I look in the mirror.

00:18:46.020 --> 00:18:47.520
But I had no idea

00:18:48.320 --> 00:18:49.320
what he was

00:18:49.820 --> 00:18:51.110
or what he wanted from me.

00:18:54.400 --> 00:18:55.690
Until one day,

00:18:57.900 --> 00:18:59.190
I had a confrontation with him.

00:19:01.270 --> 00:19:03.480
I asked him what he wanted from me.

00:19:03.610 --> 00:19:04.860
Come out here!

00:19:04.900 --> 00:19:05.940
But my dad was very mad...

00:19:06.570 --> 00:19:09.320
Everything was an illusion
that you created, Alan.

00:19:10.320 --> 00:19:12.570
and he went on to smash
every mirror in the house.

00:19:12.570 --> 00:19:13.570
Then...

00:19:18.360 --> 00:19:19.860
the next thing I knew,

00:19:20.690 --> 00:19:21.940
I found myself here.

00:19:26.900 --> 00:19:28.690
That's why I wanted to ask Dr.Nil

00:19:28.690 --> 00:19:30.650
why my dad brought me here.

00:19:31.440 --> 00:19:32.770
Do you get the feelings...

00:19:34.020 --> 00:19:35.940
that the day before
you left home

00:19:37.440 --> 00:19:38.860
and the day you arrived here

00:19:39.360 --> 00:19:41.400
felt differently, like you
were in another movie

00:19:41.860 --> 00:19:43.070
or another world?

00:19:43.940 --> 00:19:45.110
Who do you mean?

00:19:50.520 --> 00:19:52.570
Everyone here has the same idea.

00:19:52.770 --> 00:19:53.940
The sensation...

00:19:54.690 --> 00:19:56.820
of being transported
to an alternate world.

00:20:00.820 --> 00:20:02.150
You know what it resembles?

00:20:04.400 --> 00:20:05.400
Resembles to what?

00:20:12.150 --> 00:20:13.650
An after life.

00:20:16.480 --> 00:20:17.940
The place where
time doesn't pass.

00:20:18.400 --> 00:20:19.730
We are the only ones...

00:20:21.400 --> 00:20:24.360
who must await judgment
before crossing to the next realm.

00:20:29.230 --> 00:20:30.940
You watched a
lot of movies, huh?

00:20:31.440 --> 00:20:32.440
I don't buy it.

00:20:35.900 --> 00:20:38.610
Do ghosts remember the
time of their own deaths?

00:20:41.820 --> 00:20:42.820
You know...

00:20:43.820 --> 00:20:44.820
when we die,

00:20:46.480 --> 00:20:48.400
the memory of our final moment

00:20:49.150 --> 00:20:50.150
will be erased.

00:20:57.940 --> 00:20:59.820
That's why voids
between memories exists.

00:20:59.820 --> 00:21:00.820
Definitely.

00:21:01.940 --> 00:21:03.520
Just like when you were
living your normal life

00:21:03.570 --> 00:21:04.440
Alan.

00:21:04.570 --> 00:21:05.900
and then suddenly woke up here.

00:21:16.270 --> 00:21:17.270
I don't believe it.

00:21:19.070 --> 00:21:20.610
But it's written
all over your face

00:21:20.820 --> 00:21:21.820
that you do.

00:21:40.900 --> 00:21:41.900
Fine, don't believe me.

00:21:44.690 --> 00:21:46.020
Return the tray when
you're done eating.

00:21:46.400 --> 00:21:47.400
I'm going to the restroom.

00:21:48.230 --> 00:21:50.610
See you there, I'll
take you to a spot.

00:21:53.360 --> 00:21:54.690
Wait, where are we going?

00:22:06.190 --> 00:22:07.190
Alan.

00:22:07.570 --> 00:22:08.860
I see you've finished your meal.

00:22:11.110 --> 00:22:11.860
Yes.

00:22:12.150 --> 00:22:13.650
How is everything?

00:22:13.690 --> 00:22:15.320
Did you enjoy your meal?

00:22:16.770 --> 00:22:17.770
It was great.

00:22:19.070 --> 00:22:19.770
Oh…

00:22:19.860 --> 00:22:21.270
This is Phirantorn,

00:22:21.480 --> 00:22:22.770
the new nurse.

00:22:22.820 --> 00:22:25.020
He'll be assisting me and
Dr.Nil in taking care of this place.

00:22:26.150 --> 00:22:27.320
Okay...

00:22:29.440 --> 00:22:30.440
Hello.

00:22:30.980 --> 00:22:31.980
Hello, Mr. Alan.

00:22:33.480 --> 00:22:34.860
You can call me, Pete.

00:22:35.020 --> 00:22:36.440
Nice to meet you.

00:22:39.900 --> 00:22:40.860
Alan,

00:22:40.860 --> 00:22:43.650
we have an appointment
this afternoon.

00:22:43.730 --> 00:22:45.320
Performing the CT scan.

00:22:45.360 --> 00:22:46.650
Are you ready to go now?

00:22:48.360 --> 00:22:50.650
I need use the restroom first

00:22:50.650 --> 00:22:51.650
then I'll meet you there.

00:22:52.270 --> 00:22:53.610
Where can I find Dr.Nil's room?

00:22:55.320 --> 00:22:57.650
You can ask the nurse
when you're done.

00:22:57.820 --> 00:22:59.730
And maybe ask them to walk you there.

00:23:01.270 --> 00:23:02.270
Okay.

00:23:03.570 --> 00:23:05.270
Excuse me for a moment.

00:23:05.820 --> 00:23:06.730
Alright.

00:23:22.480 --> 00:23:23.480
That's Alan.

00:23:25.730 --> 00:23:28.520
I would like you to observe

00:23:28.570 --> 00:23:30.070
the CT scan procedure
this afternoon

00:23:30.110 --> 00:23:31.980
and start following
up on Alan's case

00:23:31.980 --> 00:23:33.570
together with me.

00:23:34.900 --> 00:23:35.900
Alan?

00:23:36.770 --> 00:23:38.190
Is his case

00:23:38.190 --> 00:23:39.900
more unique compared to others?

00:23:42.020 --> 00:23:43.020
Actually...

00:23:44.320 --> 00:23:45.820
all of the cases here

00:23:46.270 --> 00:23:47.730
are unique in their own ways.

00:23:48.570 --> 00:23:49.570
Just...

00:23:50.820 --> 00:23:52.440
Please try not to

00:23:52.440 --> 00:23:55.360
talk with patients
unless neccesary.

00:23:56.480 --> 00:23:58.400
And you should be very careful

00:23:58.400 --> 00:23:59.940
with your actions.

00:24:00.480 --> 00:24:01.480
Okay, Doc.

00:24:01.900 --> 00:24:03.860
As you've already known,

00:24:03.860 --> 00:24:05.230
this place is unlike
any other place.

00:24:05.690 --> 00:24:08.440
Using what you've
experienced in the past

00:24:08.480 --> 00:24:10.860
would not be possible here.

00:24:11.650 --> 00:24:12.650
Alright, Doc.

00:24:12.900 --> 00:24:13.900
Got it.

00:24:13.980 --> 00:24:14.980
My best advice is that

00:24:15.820 --> 00:24:17.520
you better not say anything.

00:24:20.400 --> 00:24:21.020
Okay.

00:24:22.020 --> 00:24:23.020
Come.

00:24:30.150 --> 00:24:32.270
Hey, you done?

00:24:34.730 --> 00:24:35.940
You're taking forever.

00:24:37.730 --> 00:24:38.730
Win.

00:24:46.320 --> 00:24:47.320
Where are you?

00:24:48.610 --> 00:24:49.610
Win?

00:24:56.190 --> 00:24:57.190
Win.

00:24:59.110 --> 00:24:59.940
Oh…

00:25:00.520 --> 00:25:02.110
Not making a sound, huh?

00:25:04.770 --> 00:25:06.020
You're taking so long to poop.

00:25:09.860 --> 00:25:11.360
I'll wait outside, okay?

00:25:32.730 --> 00:25:33.940
Hey, Win.

00:25:34.520 --> 00:25:35.360
Win.

00:25:35.360 --> 00:25:37.150
Is this you?

00:25:37.820 --> 00:25:39.150
Answer me.

00:25:39.650 --> 00:25:41.110
This isn't funny.

00:25:41.150 --> 00:25:42.150
Win!

00:26:18.070 --> 00:26:20.230
This will be the important
stage of treatment

00:26:20.440 --> 00:26:21.440
to help us understand

00:26:21.480 --> 00:26:24.020
and assess your
conditions better.

00:26:25.820 --> 00:26:28.150
I'm going to perform
a brain CT scan

00:26:28.190 --> 00:26:31.110
since it will help with
treatment efficiency.

00:26:31.610 --> 00:26:33.110
But you don't need to be scared.

00:26:33.150 --> 00:26:34.150
It won't hurt at all.

00:26:34.480 --> 00:26:36.860
You just need to get inside
the device for a brief moment.

00:27:02.110 --> 00:27:03.110
Are you ready?

00:27:08.770 --> 00:27:09.770
Doctor.

00:27:11.980 --> 00:27:13.940
I have something
I'd like to ask you.

00:27:16.070 --> 00:27:17.110
You can ask anything.

00:27:22.230 --> 00:27:24.110
I've read every page

00:27:25.690 --> 00:27:27.110
of this notebook.

00:27:30.070 --> 00:27:31.650
But could you please tell me

00:27:33.360 --> 00:27:34.770
what am I doing here?

00:27:37.440 --> 00:27:39.770
Do you remember anything
before you came here?

00:27:39.980 --> 00:27:41.610
Answer my
question first, doctor.

00:27:45.610 --> 00:27:46.610
Okay...

00:27:48.190 --> 00:27:49.150
Please calm down, Alan.

00:27:49.820 --> 00:27:52.110
If you still don't want to
tell me about something,

00:27:52.480 --> 00:27:53.610
that's totally fine.

00:27:55.230 --> 00:27:56.860
But you can trust me.

00:27:57.610 --> 00:27:59.860
I'm your case's personal doctor.

00:28:00.400 --> 00:28:02.610
That means I need to
know whatever happened.

00:28:08.900 --> 00:28:09.900
That day...

00:28:14.400 --> 00:28:16.150
I saw the old man
ghost in the mirror.

00:28:18.320 --> 00:28:19.820
But it wasn't like
the other times.

00:28:21.980 --> 00:28:22.980
It wasn't?

00:28:24.190 --> 00:28:25.190
How?

00:28:27.360 --> 00:28:29.980
It seemed like he was trying
to communicate with me.

00:28:31.980 --> 00:28:33.900
so I waited in front of the mirror.

00:28:34.190 --> 00:28:35.190
You think you're tough.

00:28:35.230 --> 00:28:36.770
Come out and get me!

00:28:37.520 --> 00:28:38.770
But my dad got very mad.

00:28:39.610 --> 00:28:40.900
Very, very mad.

00:28:42.270 --> 00:28:43.730
He ran all around the house,

00:28:43.770 --> 00:28:45.230
smashing every mirror.

00:28:45.270 --> 00:28:46.270
Alan.

00:28:46.520 --> 00:28:47.980
Did you wait in
front of the mirror?

00:28:50.730 --> 00:28:52.650
To communicate back at him?

00:28:55.860 --> 00:28:57.270
Why would you do that?

00:28:59.900 --> 00:29:00.900
I just thought that

00:29:02.150 --> 00:29:03.610
I might learn something

00:29:04.730 --> 00:29:06.230
if I had the
courage to face him.

00:29:06.860 --> 00:29:08.070
Are you aware

00:29:08.440 --> 00:29:10.860
that everything should go

00:29:11.440 --> 00:29:13.020
according to the treatment plan?

00:29:14.110 --> 00:29:16.270
Also, everyone
wants the best for you

00:29:16.520 --> 00:29:18.610
and hopes to see you get better.

00:29:21.150 --> 00:29:22.690
Does it matter, doctor?

00:29:23.650 --> 00:29:25.230
In the end, I'm still not cured.

00:29:25.270 --> 00:29:26.650
I still haven't gotten better.

00:29:26.770 --> 00:29:29.480
- I don't want to see him anymore!
- It's going to need some time.

00:29:29.860 --> 00:29:31.360
If you cooperate,

00:29:31.940 --> 00:29:34.320
everything can proceed
according to the steps

00:29:34.360 --> 00:29:35.520
that planned.

00:29:35.980 --> 00:29:36.980
Steps?

00:29:37.320 --> 00:29:39.110
What goals have you set?

00:29:39.570 --> 00:29:40.570
For what?

00:29:40.860 --> 00:29:42.020
For telling me that I'm crazy?

00:29:42.360 --> 00:29:43.360
I didn't say anything like that.

00:29:43.360 --> 00:29:45.440
Was everything I
saw just an illusion?

00:29:45.480 --> 00:29:46.480
Alan, calm down.

00:29:47.820 --> 00:29:49.480
Now, what I'm trying to say

00:29:50.070 --> 00:29:51.860
is that you, Alan,

00:29:52.360 --> 00:29:54.360
shouldn't skip the steps

00:29:54.860 --> 00:29:57.230
or do anything rashly

00:29:57.980 --> 00:29:58.980
like what you did.

00:30:00.980 --> 00:30:03.900
Do you know that your father
was very worried about you

00:30:04.980 --> 00:30:06.480
every time something happened?

00:30:08.070 --> 00:30:10.360
And I knew that he's been trying

00:30:10.360 --> 00:30:11.940
in order to get you better.

00:30:15.820 --> 00:30:16.820
Wait.

00:30:19.860 --> 00:30:21.400
Every time something happened?

00:30:22.110 --> 00:30:23.480
Yes, every time.

00:30:25.570 --> 00:30:26.570
What did you mean?

00:30:28.440 --> 00:30:29.440
It meant that...

00:30:30.900 --> 00:30:33.690
This isn't the first time that
something like this has happened.

00:30:34.440 --> 00:30:37.190
And I understand as well why,

00:30:37.230 --> 00:30:39.150
on that day, your father...

00:30:39.650 --> 00:30:40.900
had a breakdown.

00:30:42.150 --> 00:30:43.770
Because your father
really cared for you.

00:30:44.690 --> 00:30:46.360
He was afraid that something
bad would happen to you,

00:30:46.400 --> 00:30:48.070
so he didn't want you
to become obsessed

00:30:48.110 --> 00:30:50.400
with the illusion,
like that one time.

00:30:51.900 --> 00:30:52.900
That one time?

00:30:53.940 --> 00:30:55.270
When was "that
one time," doctor?

00:30:56.020 --> 00:30:57.020
Huh?

00:30:57.020 --> 00:30:58.690
It was when you sleep-walked

00:30:59.570 --> 00:31:01.110
down from your bedroom

00:31:01.110 --> 00:31:03.150
to the storage room,
which had mirrors

00:31:04.070 --> 00:31:04.570
everywhere.

00:31:04.610 --> 00:31:06.230
And then you...

00:31:06.270 --> 00:31:07.400
locked yourself in there.

00:31:08.900 --> 00:31:09.900
That's not true.

00:31:10.150 --> 00:31:11.150
Not true.

00:31:11.820 --> 00:31:12.820
I've never done that.

00:31:13.480 --> 00:31:14.650
You and dad

00:31:14.690 --> 00:31:16.650
worked together and
made up a story to trick me.

00:31:16.690 --> 00:31:18.690
Everything I said has happened.

00:31:18.900 --> 00:31:21.110
- No.
- But it has.

00:31:21.110 --> 00:31:22.110
It's not true.

00:31:23.320 --> 00:31:24.320
It has happened.

00:31:27.650 --> 00:31:28.650
You're lying.

00:31:28.650 --> 00:31:29.900
You and dad

00:31:29.900 --> 00:31:31.860
worked together
to trick me, right?

00:31:31.860 --> 00:31:33.770
Everything has
happened before, Alan.

00:31:34.230 --> 00:31:34.900
It hasn't.

00:31:34.940 --> 00:31:36.440
Why would I lie to you?

00:31:37.440 --> 00:31:38.900
Where's the evidence, Doc?

00:31:38.980 --> 00:31:40.440
If it's really happened, where?

00:31:40.820 --> 00:31:41.980
Here, where?

00:31:42.360 --> 00:31:44.150
I've read every single page.

00:31:44.400 --> 00:31:45.400
Where, Doc?

00:31:46.150 --> 00:31:47.230
If it was really important,

00:31:47.650 --> 00:31:49.320
then you must have
told me to write it down.

00:31:49.320 --> 00:31:50.480
Like all the other times.

00:31:50.770 --> 00:31:51.980
If it was so important,

00:31:52.190 --> 00:31:53.690
how could I not
have written it here?

00:31:53.730 --> 00:31:54.860
Alan.

00:31:54.900 --> 00:31:55.900
- Alan.
- Where?

00:31:55.940 --> 00:31:57.110
You're lying to me, huh?

00:31:57.150 --> 00:31:59.230
- Alan, get a hold on to yourself.
- You're nothing but bullshit!

00:31:59.230 --> 00:32:01.270
Would you please calm now?

00:32:04.320 --> 00:32:05.320
It will...

00:32:05.860 --> 00:32:07.730
It will pass, just like it has every time.

00:32:08.400 --> 00:32:09.400
Every time?

00:32:09.940 --> 00:32:10.940
That one time?

00:32:11.440 --> 00:32:12.440
Just like it has?

00:32:13.480 --> 00:32:14.650
What "every time"?

00:32:15.230 --> 00:32:16.230
What did you mean?

00:32:17.770 --> 00:32:19.650
Has all of this happened before?

00:32:19.650 --> 00:32:20.190
What?

00:32:20.650 --> 00:32:21.650
What is this?

00:32:22.900 --> 00:32:25.190
You and dad worked
together and made up a story

00:32:25.360 --> 00:32:26.650
to trick me, huh?

00:32:26.900 --> 00:32:27.900
No.

00:32:27.940 --> 00:32:29.440
I won't ever believe
anything you say.

00:32:31.190 --> 00:32:32.980
I'll never trust anyone in this place.

00:32:33.150 --> 00:32:34.110
This journal

00:32:34.110 --> 00:32:35.270
is all a lie!

00:32:35.320 --> 00:32:36.820
Look...

00:32:36.820 --> 00:32:37.730
You tricked me!

00:32:37.730 --> 00:32:40.400
If you're not ready to perform CT scan,

00:32:40.440 --> 00:32:41.440
then we don't have to.

00:32:41.610 --> 00:32:42.860
We can do this another day.

00:32:42.860 --> 00:32:43.730
No.

00:32:43.770 --> 00:32:44.400
I won't.

00:32:44.440 --> 00:32:46.070
Fuck the CT scan.

00:32:46.070 --> 00:32:47.230
And I won't ever believe...

00:32:47.230 --> 00:32:48.570
Enough!

00:32:49.320 --> 00:32:50.320
This is a waste of time.

00:32:50.360 --> 00:32:51.360
I'm getting tired of listening.

00:32:52.570 --> 00:32:55.110
If the patient refuses
treatment, then let him go.

00:32:58.940 --> 00:33:00.480
I've seen many cases like this.

00:33:00.980 --> 00:33:03.820
Shouldn't we be spending
our time on willing patients

00:33:04.150 --> 00:33:05.400
If he doesn't want to be scanned

00:33:05.690 --> 00:33:07.070
just let him be.

00:33:07.650 --> 00:33:09.860
This is a waste of our valuable time.

00:33:10.400 --> 00:33:11.400
Doctor.

00:33:11.730 --> 00:33:12.730
You know how it is.

00:33:13.230 --> 00:33:15.320
If the patient refuses to
receive treatment here,

00:33:15.400 --> 00:33:17.150
then simply send
them to an asylum,

00:33:17.610 --> 00:33:20.110
maybe they have more
severe methods of treatment.

00:33:20.520 --> 00:33:22.520
For the patient who's
unaware of their illness,

00:33:22.570 --> 00:33:24.190
I think this is an
excellent idea.

00:33:24.570 --> 00:33:26.860
Just inject them with
tranquilizers to numb them.

00:33:27.480 --> 00:33:29.230
Or maybe put them
in electrotherapy.

00:33:29.900 --> 00:33:32.820
We don't have to waste
time arguing anymore.

00:33:35.860 --> 00:33:36.860
Oh, Doctor.

00:33:37.360 --> 00:33:38.480
It's almost 3 p.m. now.

00:33:39.070 --> 00:33:40.860
There's another
patient in the queue too.

00:33:41.570 --> 00:33:42.570
So, how're we doing this?

00:33:42.980 --> 00:33:44.480
Should I send them
the name right now?

00:33:45.270 --> 00:33:46.270
So we can move on.

00:33:47.980 --> 00:33:49.400
So we can go our seperate ways.

00:33:49.860 --> 00:33:51.320
We don't need to do
the scanning anymore.

00:33:51.480 --> 00:33:53.020
It seems pointless to me.

00:33:55.690 --> 00:33:56.690
Send?

00:33:57.730 --> 00:33:59.440
Send the name where?

00:34:00.480 --> 00:34:02.070
The asylum, Alan.

00:34:02.980 --> 00:34:04.650
If this place can not treat you,

00:34:04.690 --> 00:34:06.650
we may have to refer
you to another facility.

00:34:06.940 --> 00:34:08.110
Isn't that right, Dr.Nil?

00:34:08.150 --> 00:34:09.360
Please tell him.

00:34:22.480 --> 00:34:24.690
Are you guys trying to trick me?

00:34:25.520 --> 00:34:27.440
It won't work, I'm not scared.

00:34:34.570 --> 00:34:35.520
Alan.

00:34:35.570 --> 00:34:36.570
Listen to me.

00:34:36.900 --> 00:34:38.440
CT scan

00:34:38.900 --> 00:34:40.520
is a basic procedure.

00:34:40.770 --> 00:34:42.150
You still gotta do it anyway.

00:34:42.320 --> 00:34:43.320
No other way around.

00:34:44.400 --> 00:34:46.520
Please don't waste anymore time.

00:34:47.730 --> 00:34:48.730
Right, Doc?

00:34:50.020 --> 00:34:51.320
All of us

00:34:51.360 --> 00:34:53.230
are following the
treatment steps.

00:34:54.190 --> 00:34:56.110
We only need to scan your brain.

00:34:56.520 --> 00:34:59.570
There may not be
any anomalies at all.

00:35:13.730 --> 00:35:14.730
Hold up, Doc.

00:35:15.440 --> 00:35:16.440
What's this about?

00:35:18.270 --> 00:35:19.270
Pete.

00:35:19.400 --> 00:35:22.070
The way you spoke
to the patient...

00:35:22.360 --> 00:35:24.610
Do you still want to work here?

00:35:25.820 --> 00:35:27.940
Well, he's agreeing to
be scanned now, right?

00:35:28.940 --> 00:35:30.230
Do you realize

00:35:30.270 --> 00:35:32.980
that what you did could worsen his condition?

00:35:35.400 --> 00:35:36.940
Then I apologize

00:35:37.400 --> 00:35:38.520
for causing trouble.

00:35:43.440 --> 00:35:44.440
Pete.

00:35:44.770 --> 00:35:45.770
Yes, Doctor?

00:35:50.360 --> 00:35:51.610
Go look after Alan

00:35:52.650 --> 00:35:54.070
and walk him back to his room.

00:35:54.860 --> 00:35:57.940
We'll read the CT
scan result tomorrow.

00:35:58.730 --> 00:36:00.070
Yes, doctor.

00:36:23.940 --> 00:36:25.190
Get up slowly, Alan.

00:36:25.980 --> 00:36:27.230
Come, let me help.

00:36:31.570 --> 00:36:33.520
Have you recently
started working here?

00:36:34.110 --> 00:36:34.940
Yeah,

00:36:34.940 --> 00:36:36.940
this is my first
day working here.

00:36:38.440 --> 00:36:39.440
You know,

00:36:39.480 --> 00:36:40.860
you're the kind of nurse that...

00:36:40.860 --> 00:36:41.520
That what?

00:36:43.440 --> 00:36:45.190
Am I allowed to
say foul-mouthed?

00:36:46.150 --> 00:36:47.400
Everyone who knows me

00:36:47.570 --> 00:36:48.900
has said the same thing.

00:36:51.110 --> 00:36:52.940
When we met in the cafeteria,

00:36:53.230 --> 00:36:55.150
you gave me a greeting nod.

00:36:55.610 --> 00:36:56.940
That seemed very gentle.

00:36:57.190 --> 00:36:58.400
Unlike what had just happened.

00:36:59.400 --> 00:37:00.650
So who did you nod to?

00:37:01.570 --> 00:37:02.570
Let me tell you.

00:37:03.270 --> 00:37:05.940
I nodded to the old man
who walked past you.

00:37:09.020 --> 00:37:10.820
An old man who
walked past my back?

00:37:11.480 --> 00:37:12.480
Who was he?

00:37:13.270 --> 00:37:14.270
Umm.

00:37:17.360 --> 00:37:18.570
That old man.

00:37:18.610 --> 00:37:20.110
Just forget it, Alan.

00:37:21.980 --> 00:37:22.980
Pete didn't answer.

00:37:24.320 --> 00:37:26.020
But it made me certain that

00:37:26.020 --> 00:37:28.520
Pete saw the old man's
ghost following behind me.

00:37:29.190 --> 00:37:31.320
That means it was
actually a ghost,

00:37:31.860 --> 00:37:33.650
not just a figment
of my imagination.

00:37:34.730 --> 00:37:36.440
But how could Pete see it?

00:37:38.110 --> 00:37:39.980
Even with no mirrors.

00:38:00.520 --> 00:38:01.520
Alan.

00:38:02.320 --> 00:38:03.320
You sleeping?

00:38:03.570 --> 00:38:04.940
It's me.

00:38:11.270 --> 00:38:12.270
Win?

00:38:14.520 --> 00:38:15.520
Win.

00:38:18.440 --> 00:38:19.820
Yeah, it's me.

00:38:21.520 --> 00:38:22.570
What's wrong?

00:38:23.110 --> 00:38:24.110
You alright?

00:38:26.730 --> 00:38:27.730
I can't do this.

00:38:28.360 --> 00:38:29.360
I'm scared.

00:38:30.820 --> 00:38:32.190
I'm so scared.

00:38:39.940 --> 00:38:42.270
You saw that old
man ghost again?

00:38:50.770 --> 00:38:51.770
It's okay.

00:38:52.770 --> 00:38:54.070
Everything will be fine.

00:38:54.520 --> 00:38:55.520
I'm right here.

00:39:15.610 --> 00:39:16.610
It's okay.

00:39:23.860 --> 00:39:25.270
I feel so much better

00:39:26.610 --> 00:39:27.900
with you here.

00:39:30.610 --> 00:39:31.400
What happened to you?

00:39:31.400 --> 00:39:32.400
Tell me.

00:39:34.520 --> 00:39:35.690
What made you so scared?

00:39:38.900 --> 00:39:39.650
Well...

00:39:42.230 --> 00:39:44.110
It showed up to me again.

00:39:46.610 --> 00:39:47.770
In the mirror over there.

00:39:48.070 --> 00:39:49.070
Oh.

00:39:52.730 --> 00:39:53.980
You got a good look at it?

00:39:57.940 --> 00:39:58.940
Yeah.

00:40:03.610 --> 00:40:05.020
I can't take this anymore.

00:40:06.980 --> 00:40:07.980
I'm scared.

00:40:09.150 --> 00:40:10.150
I can't go on like this.

00:40:10.860 --> 00:40:11.900
It's alright.

00:40:13.360 --> 00:40:14.360
I'm here.

00:40:21.520 --> 00:40:23.230
Have you ever wondered

00:40:24.230 --> 00:40:25.440
if the old man that you talked about

00:40:27.900 --> 00:40:29.150
would show up

00:40:30.070 --> 00:40:31.610
when I'm with you?

00:40:35.320 --> 00:40:36.320
What do you mean?

00:40:39.440 --> 00:40:40.440
You and me,

00:40:41.610 --> 00:40:43.270
shall we go look in
the mirror together?

00:40:50.360 --> 00:40:51.860
If you see it, don't worry.

00:40:53.440 --> 00:40:54.650
I'm right beside you.

00:40:58.940 --> 00:40:59.940
Will it be okay?

00:41:08.320 --> 00:41:10.070
But if we see it,

00:41:11.190 --> 00:41:12.190
don't leave me.

00:41:14.190 --> 00:41:15.190
Yeah.

00:41:15.320 --> 00:41:16.320
I got you.

00:41:19.570 --> 00:41:20.570
Come.

00:41:52.270 --> 00:41:52.770
Hey.

00:41:52.770 --> 00:41:54.150
What?

00:41:54.440 --> 00:41:55.440
What did you see?

00:41:56.400 --> 00:41:57.730
I noticed you were pretty quiet.

00:41:58.360 --> 00:41:59.360
Come take a look.

00:41:59.940 --> 00:42:00.940
Asshole.

00:42:00.940 --> 00:42:02.440
Don't ever do that again.

00:42:03.020 --> 00:42:04.400
You startled me.

00:42:16.270 --> 00:42:17.270
I don't see anything.

00:42:25.230 --> 00:42:26.230
What was that?

00:42:27.270 --> 00:42:28.270
I dunno.

00:42:36.360 --> 00:42:37.320
Hey...

00:42:37.320 --> 00:42:38.320
Come on.

00:42:41.690 --> 00:42:42.690
What do you see?

00:42:44.770 --> 00:42:45.770
You see anything?

00:42:46.020 --> 00:42:47.020
Nothing.

00:42:49.820 --> 00:42:50.820
Oh.

00:42:52.730 --> 00:42:53.610
There's nothing here.

00:42:53.610 --> 00:42:54.610
Nothing at all.

00:42:54.690 --> 00:42:55.690
What are you doing in there?

00:42:56.900 --> 00:42:57.900
What are you doing?

00:42:59.070 --> 00:43:00.070
What are you doing?

00:43:00.230 --> 00:43:00.900
Someone's coming.

00:43:00.940 --> 00:43:01.940
Mr.Alan.

00:43:02.820 --> 00:43:03.820
Mr.Alan!

00:43:04.440 --> 00:43:05.110
Under the bed, quick!

00:43:05.110 --> 00:43:06.110
Mr.Alan.

00:43:07.480 --> 00:43:08.480
Mr.Alan.

00:43:09.230 --> 00:43:10.230
Mr.Alan.

00:43:11.110 --> 00:43:12.690
Mr.Alan!

00:43:18.070 --> 00:43:19.070
Mr.Alan.

00:43:19.320 --> 00:43:20.570
Get up, Mr.Alan.

00:43:21.770 --> 00:43:22.770
Hurry up.

00:43:22.940 --> 00:43:23.940
Follow me.

00:43:25.940 --> 00:43:27.270
Wait, where are we going?

00:43:27.480 --> 00:43:28.480
Please follow me.

00:43:39.020 --> 00:43:40.020
Hurry!

00:43:40.690 --> 00:43:41.820
Over here.

00:43:43.940 --> 00:43:44.940
Wait.

00:43:45.070 --> 00:43:46.070
Where are we going?

00:43:46.400 --> 00:43:47.400
Right this way.
