(Adapted from "The Highborn Matron Reborn as the Pitiful Heiress")

00:00:53.580 --> 00:00:56.820
=Episode 22=

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:05.640
That night, I was drinking alone.

00:01:06.319 --> 00:01:07.519
Shiqi came to see me

00:01:07.519 --> 00:01:08.719
and had a drink with me.

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:11.120
She's my biological sister.

00:01:11.799 --> 00:01:12.959
Why would she ever drug me?

00:01:15.439 --> 00:01:17.760
Sometimes the person
who seems least likely

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:20.280
turns out to be the answer.

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:22.200
She's right.

00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:25.370
After you two pretended to fall for it,

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:27.359
things became pretty clear.

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:31.920
Your sister

00:01:32.570 --> 00:01:34.239
ended up becoming head of the Gu family.

00:01:37.410 --> 00:01:39.150
Shiqi had always been
sweet and obedient.

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:40.640
She loved drawing and ballet.

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:42.319
She never showed any interest

00:01:42.319 --> 00:01:44.000
in the family business.

00:01:44.799 --> 00:01:46.300
Maybe she became the head of the family

00:01:46.519 --> 00:01:47.760
just by coincidence.

00:01:48.959 --> 00:01:50.200
Let my mother go.

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:51.400
Whatever she did,

00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:53.159
I'll take the blame for her.

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:54.159
Shut up!

00:01:54.159 --> 00:01:55.200
Take the blame for what?

00:01:55.840 --> 00:01:57.599
I'm the one who did all of this.

00:01:57.599 --> 00:01:58.799
Because I hate you.

00:01:58.799 --> 00:01:59.799
I hate the Gu family.

00:01:59.799 --> 00:02:01.200
I hate every single one of you!

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:02.239
Yansheng.

00:02:02.439 --> 00:02:02.840
Yansheng.

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:03.239
Mom…

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:03.959
Yansheng!

00:02:04.159 --> 00:02:04.560
Mom!

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:05.959
Gu Chenyu!

00:02:06.159 --> 00:02:07.640
The Gu family will be mine!

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:09.520
It's mine!

00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:14.800
Gu Chenyu,

00:02:15.639 --> 00:02:16.439
what do you think?

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:18.840
Everything we've said
is just speculation.

00:02:19.319 --> 00:02:20.080
There's no proof.

00:02:21.439 --> 00:02:22.599
But I think there's one person

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:25.680
who might know something.

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:32.439
You've got five minutes for the visit.

00:02:39.439 --> 00:02:40.400
Gu Chenyu.

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:42.280
Did you really go blind?

00:02:52.199 --> 00:02:54.159
Looks like your karma's worse than mine.

00:02:57.639 --> 00:02:59.000
Your trial's coming up soon, right?

00:03:00.159 --> 00:03:01.639
Premeditated murder,

00:03:01.639 --> 00:03:02.919
intentional injury,

00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:04.759
and contract killing.

00:03:06.159 --> 00:03:08.160
You might never get out
for the rest of your life.

00:03:11.919 --> 00:03:13.360
You came here to see me in despair?

00:03:14.639 --> 00:03:15.919
Dream on.

00:03:18.240 --> 00:03:19.360
The new head

00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:21.240
of the Gu family

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:23.400
is my son.

00:03:24.439 --> 00:03:25.080
You,

00:03:25.319 --> 00:03:26.159
Gu Chenyu,

00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:27.599
you lost.

00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:30.879
I suppose you don't know yet.

00:03:32.199 --> 00:03:33.639
Gu Yansheng kidnapped Yunyun.

00:03:34.759 --> 00:03:35.560
They're missing.

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:37.800
He is now wanted by the police.

00:03:38.439 --> 00:03:39.039
Lies!

00:03:39.479 --> 00:03:40.080
You're lying!

00:03:41.719 --> 00:03:42.960
You can check for yourself.

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:45.080
If you don't believe me,

00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:46.280
ask the officers.

00:03:47.719 --> 00:03:49.319
All I want now is to find Yunyun.

00:03:49.919 --> 00:03:51.240
I don't have time to joke around.

00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:52.919
This can't be.

00:03:53.439 --> 00:03:54.360
This isn't true.

00:03:55.439 --> 00:03:57.319
He's a good boy.

00:03:57.319 --> 00:03:58.599
He'd never do this.

00:03:58.599 --> 00:04:00.400
How could he do something like that?

00:04:00.610 --> 00:04:01.690
He'd never do such a thing.

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:03.100
What about Gu Shiqi, then?

00:04:03.520 --> 00:04:04.560
I suspect

00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:06.080
before Yansheng kidnapped Yunyun,

00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:08.560
Shiqi drugged him with psychotropics.

00:04:13.599 --> 00:04:14.599
You're just guessing.

00:04:14.759 --> 00:04:15.800
You're all just guessing.

00:04:16.879 --> 00:04:18.560
Shiqi and Yansheng are siblings

00:04:18.920 --> 00:04:19.800
by blood.

00:04:19.800 --> 00:04:20.920
Why would she do that?

00:04:20.920 --> 00:04:21.920
Why?

00:04:21.920 --> 00:04:23.480
To become head of the Gu family.

00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:26.800
Mom,

00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:28.399
don't worry.

00:04:28.759 --> 00:04:30.199
No one's going to drive us out.

00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:32.160
Grandma looks down on us,

00:04:33.639 --> 00:04:36.720
so I'll make sure everything
in the Gu family

00:04:38.319 --> 00:04:40.000
becomes mine.

00:04:42.040 --> 00:04:43.759
One family disaster after another.

00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:48.000
Shiqi is now living high
as the new head of the Gu family.

00:04:48.759 --> 00:04:49.959
Your trial's coming up.

00:04:51.120 --> 00:04:52.560
Your son's become a public enemy.

00:04:53.920 --> 00:04:55.160
If the police catch him,

00:04:56.639 --> 00:04:57.959
he'll end up just like you.

00:04:59.439 --> 00:05:01.439
That wench…

00:05:01.639 --> 00:05:04.800
She ruined my son!

00:05:08.319 --> 00:05:10.800
Only Yansheng and Shiqi
know where Yunyun is.

00:05:13.319 --> 00:05:14.759
I can help Yansheng.

00:05:15.120 --> 00:05:16.199
We're still brothers.

00:05:16.240 --> 00:05:18.240
I can try to help him
get a lighter sentence.

00:05:19.959 --> 00:05:20.639
But

00:05:21.199 --> 00:05:23.040
you've got to help me
find something on Shiqi,

00:05:23.639 --> 00:05:25.120
something we can use to make her talk.

00:05:26.399 --> 00:05:28.120
All I care about is finding Yunyun.

00:05:28.600 --> 00:05:29.720
The choice is yours.

00:05:31.639 --> 00:05:32.920
If you don't help me,

00:05:34.120 --> 00:05:35.519
I can't help Yansheng.

00:05:48.399 --> 00:05:49.199
Wait.

00:05:53.839 --> 00:05:54.920
Gu Shiqi

00:05:56.120 --> 00:05:58.040
isn't a Gu.

00:05:58.319 --> 00:05:59.079
Her real father's

00:05:59.319 --> 00:06:00.720
a pharmacist.

00:06:01.399 --> 00:06:02.319
A few months ago,

00:06:02.839 --> 00:06:04.560
he found out about her

00:06:05.560 --> 00:06:07.360
and started asking her for money,

00:06:08.560 --> 00:06:09.759
doing things for her.

00:06:11.199 --> 00:06:12.439
Where's that man now?

00:06:14.160 --> 00:06:15.360
Eat up.

00:06:15.360 --> 00:06:16.560
I prepared all this for you.

00:06:18.040 --> 00:06:19.600
A daughter dotes on her father.

00:06:27.879 --> 00:06:28.839
Delicious.

00:06:29.240 --> 00:06:30.040
Here, Shiqi.

00:06:31.519 --> 00:06:32.319
Cheers.

00:06:32.839 --> 00:06:33.720
Congratulations.

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:35.639
You're now the head of the Gu family.

00:06:36.160 --> 00:06:38.519
Bai Lanxing gave me
a wonderful daughter.

00:06:45.800 --> 00:06:46.839
Dad.

00:06:47.580 --> 00:06:48.759
Here's the money you wanted.

00:06:48.959 --> 00:06:49.519
200,000.

00:06:50.639 --> 00:06:51.839
You should stop gambling.

00:06:54.160 --> 00:06:55.399
Shiqi,

00:06:56.319 --> 00:06:59.360
the entire Gu family fortune
belongs to you now.

00:06:59.400 --> 00:07:01.199
Giving me just this much
doesn't seem right,

00:07:02.319 --> 00:07:03.639
does it?

00:07:04.820 --> 00:07:05.839
Here's what you should do.

00:07:06.720 --> 00:07:08.199
Give me some shares

00:07:08.519 --> 00:07:09.439
in Gu Group,

00:07:09.759 --> 00:07:11.879
and a nice position while you're at it.

00:07:12.160 --> 00:07:13.839
After all, I'm your real father.

00:07:14.199 --> 00:07:15.759
Can't have me living too shabby, right?

00:07:17.240 --> 00:07:18.959
Our relationship has to stay secret.

00:07:19.439 --> 00:07:21.560
You'd better stay away from Gu Group.

00:07:23.399 --> 00:07:24.959
I bought a villa in the US.

00:07:24.959 --> 00:07:26.279
It's a beautiful place.

00:07:26.279 --> 00:07:28.040
You could live there peacefully.

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:33.360
You think you're independent now?

00:07:34.240 --> 00:07:36.399
Burning bridges already?

00:07:37.240 --> 00:07:38.240
No…

00:07:38.519 --> 00:07:39.319
Let me remind you,

00:07:40.120 --> 00:07:41.759
I've got recordings of everything

00:07:42.360 --> 00:07:44.160
you asked me to do.

00:07:46.720 --> 00:07:48.439
You'd better remember,

00:07:48.439 --> 00:07:51.199
for the rest of your life,
you'll take care of me

00:07:51.399 --> 00:07:52.839
and do whatever I say.

00:07:52.839 --> 00:07:53.399
Dad,

00:07:54.079 --> 00:07:55.560
Mom's going to prison.

00:07:55.560 --> 00:07:57.399
You're the only family I've got left.

00:07:57.399 --> 00:07:59.000
How could I ever abandon you?

00:08:03.519 --> 00:08:04.680
That's more like it.

00:08:14.959 --> 00:08:16.439
What did you put in my drink?

00:08:16.839 --> 00:08:18.480
I feel dizzy…

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:23.240
Don't be scared.

00:08:24.120 --> 00:08:25.920
It's just sleeping pills.

00:08:26.439 --> 00:08:28.000
The same ones you gave me.

00:08:28.839 --> 00:08:30.920
Just enjoy your sleep.

00:08:31.240 --> 00:08:33.639
What are you doing to me?

00:08:36.240 --> 00:08:37.279
Sleep,

00:08:37.519 --> 00:08:38.639
and never wake up.

00:08:39.120 --> 00:08:42.120
Keep dreaming
your little daydreams forever.

00:08:49.410 --> 00:08:51.799
You decided to end your life
from carbon monoxide poisoning

00:08:51.799 --> 00:08:53.490
because you can't repay
your gambling debt.

00:08:54.500 --> 00:08:55.679
Sounds believable, doesn't it?

00:09:10.919 --> 00:09:12.240
You wench!

00:09:13.960 --> 00:09:14.759
I…

00:09:17.799 --> 00:09:19.159
You're scum.

00:09:19.799 --> 00:09:21.360
You don't deserve to be my father.

00:09:25.200 --> 00:09:26.200
Where's his phone?

00:09:33.159 --> 00:09:34.159
Fu Yunyun?

00:09:34.840 --> 00:09:37.200
Gu Shiqi, the law never
lets anyone get away.

00:09:37.200 --> 00:09:38.159
You won't escape.

00:09:41.620 --> 00:09:44.975
