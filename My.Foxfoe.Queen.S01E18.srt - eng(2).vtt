00:00:13.525 --> 00:00:16.587
=Episode 18=

00:00:18.020 --> 00:00:19.179
Doctor Zhang.

00:00:19.180 --> 00:00:21.099
I read in this book

00:00:21.100 --> 00:00:24.299
about a kind of gu worm
called the Mother-Child Gu.

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:26.459
It says it can control a person's mind.

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:28.180
I find it quite interesting.

00:00:28.420 --> 00:00:30.579
But in this book,

00:00:30.580 --> 00:00:32.779
the methods of casting
and removing the Gu

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:34.700
are not described in detail.

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:37.219
So I wanted to ask you, Doctor Zhang,

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:39.020
are you familiar
with the Mother-Child Gu?

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:40.499
Your Highness,

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:43.019
I know nothing at all

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:44.780
about the art of Gu.

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:46.660
However...

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:48.940
However what?

00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:51.419
But I do know

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:53.420
of a woman on the outskirts of the city.

00:00:53.780 --> 00:00:55.899
It's said she's well-versed in Gu arts.

00:00:55.900 --> 00:00:58.179
But she's moody and unpredictable,

00:00:58.180 --> 00:00:59.899
and loves using Gu on people.

00:00:59.900 --> 00:01:01.699
Anyone who's dealt with her

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:04.020
has been more or less afflicted.

00:01:04.620 --> 00:01:05.979
I advise Your Highness

00:01:05.980 --> 00:01:07.900
not to seek her out.

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:09.659
I am the Empress.

00:01:09.660 --> 00:01:11.620
She wouldn't dare use Gu on me.

00:01:11.980 --> 00:01:13.340
Well...

00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:18.020
Even the late emperor was afflicted
by her Gu a few times.

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:22.419
But the late emperor did not punish her.

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:23.899
Instead, he built her a residence

00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:25.700
on the outskirts.

00:01:25.980 --> 00:01:27.419
Is that so?

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:28.700
Why was that?

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:30.779
I heard

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:33.020
she once saved the late emperor's life.

00:01:34.620 --> 00:01:36.060
What's her name?

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:38.819
No one knows her real name.

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:40.299
People just call her

00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:41.740
Ghost Granny.

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:43.939
Ghost Granny?

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:44.980
Yes.

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:49.419
I was just curious.

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:50.619
It was a casual question.

00:01:50.620 --> 00:01:52.220
Thank you, Doctor Zhang.

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:55.100
I take my leave.

00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:07.420
Yue,

00:02:07.900 --> 00:02:09.700
do you think the one who cast the Gu

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:11.300
could be the Ghost Granny?

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:13.419
Impossible.

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:14.979
The book says

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:17.179
the Gu caster must stay within five li

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:19.300
of the person being controlled.

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:22.700
So the caster must be inside the palace.

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:25.180
Ghost Granny lives on the outskirts,

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:28.500
dozens of li away from the palace.

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:30.900
It shouldn't be her.

00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:32.179
Never mind.

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:33.779
I'll have to ask her myself.

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:34.900
No.

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:36.579
She loves using Gu on people,

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:37.740
it's too dangerous.

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:38.940
Let me go instead.

00:02:39.460 --> 00:02:41.019
You stay here and wait.

00:02:41.020 --> 00:02:42.140
I'll be back soon.

00:02:45.820 --> 00:02:46.940
Alright.

00:03:59.300 --> 00:04:01.260
Is anyone there?

00:04:19.820 --> 00:04:21.139
If you want to die,

00:04:21.140 --> 00:04:22.580
open it.

00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:27.219
I mean no offense.

00:04:27.220 --> 00:04:28.460
My apologies.

00:04:28.900 --> 00:04:30.739
I've come to see Ghost Granny.

00:04:30.740 --> 00:04:33.180
May I ask if she's here?

00:04:36.700 --> 00:04:38.019
Your eyes and brows

00:04:38.020 --> 00:04:41.260
look just like your father's.

00:04:42.140 --> 00:04:43.620
So you are Ghost Granny.

00:04:46.940 --> 00:04:48.419
I am Xiling Xuan.

00:04:48.420 --> 00:04:50.260
I heard you're skilled in Gu arts,

00:04:50.340 --> 00:04:52.100
so I've come to ask you a few things.

00:04:53.460 --> 00:04:55.140
There are thousands of Gu.

00:04:55.380 --> 00:04:58.180
Which kind are you asking about?

00:04:59.900 --> 00:05:01.100
The Mother-Child Gu.

00:05:03.660 --> 00:05:05.180
Mother-Child Gu.

00:05:06.140 --> 00:05:09.100
Mother-Child Gu,

00:05:09.540 --> 00:05:11.379
Mother and child connected,

00:05:11.380 --> 00:05:13.620
bound through life and death,

00:05:13.940 --> 00:05:16.219
love leads to madness,

00:05:16.220 --> 00:05:18.860
fate has been defied.

00:05:20.020 --> 00:05:23.100
Please, could you be more specific?

00:05:24.260 --> 00:05:26.419
Before I change my mind
about killing you,

00:05:26.420 --> 00:05:27.580
you'd better leave now.

00:05:44.460 --> 00:05:47.020
Looks like Lord Yi has begun
to suspect something.

00:05:50.540 --> 00:05:51.940
So what?

00:05:52.500 --> 00:05:54.059
This Gu cannot be undone.

00:05:54.060 --> 00:05:55.620
There's nothing he can do.

00:05:56.180 --> 00:05:57.539
But His Majesty's had a headache

00:05:57.540 --> 00:05:59.180
since last night.

00:05:59.460 --> 00:06:00.779
If no cure is found soon,

00:06:00.780 --> 00:06:02.020
I'm afraid

00:06:02.300 --> 00:06:03.660
something bad will happen.

00:06:06.100 --> 00:06:08.540
Heng has fallen under
a demon's Charm Spell.

00:06:08.940 --> 00:06:10.339
The only way to break it

00:06:10.340 --> 00:06:12.460
is to sever all feelings of love.

00:06:13.660 --> 00:06:14.940
Sever all love?

00:06:16.580 --> 00:06:18.059
From this day on,

00:06:18.060 --> 00:06:21.780
he will never love anyone
in this world again.

00:06:23.140 --> 00:06:24.419
But if so,

00:06:24.420 --> 00:06:25.339
wouldn't His Majesty...

00:06:25.340 --> 00:06:26.860
Heng is an Emperor.

00:06:27.620 --> 00:06:30.820
He cannot let love weaken his will.

00:06:33.780 --> 00:06:35.419
Grind this insect into powder,

00:06:35.420 --> 00:06:37.300
and brew it into medicine for him.

00:06:37.380 --> 00:06:39.019
He'll recover soon enough.

00:06:39.020 --> 00:06:40.380
Yes, Your Grace.

00:06:42.425 --> 00:06:44.979
(Former Empress, Duanmu Jin)

00:06:44.980 --> 00:06:46.699
This title

00:06:46.700 --> 00:06:49.180
feels like something from a past life.

00:06:50.620 --> 00:06:52.700
Don't call me that again.

00:06:53.060 --> 00:06:54.180
Yes.

00:06:54.900 --> 00:06:56.499
But I don't understand,

00:06:56.500 --> 00:06:58.019
after all these years,

00:06:58.020 --> 00:07:00.540
why won't you acknowledge His Majesty?

00:07:03.180 --> 00:07:05.340
Just take good care of Heng.

00:07:05.420 --> 00:07:06.540
Yes.

00:07:14.900 --> 00:07:17.779
(Only if Heng believes I was killed
by demons,)

00:07:17.780 --> 00:07:20.580
(will he bear an unshakable hatred
toward them,)

00:07:20.660 --> 00:07:23.860
(so he won't repeat
the late emperor's mistake)

00:07:24.300 --> 00:07:26.659
(of falling in love with a demon.)

00:07:26.660 --> 00:07:28.540
(Only then can he destroy them
without mercy.)

00:07:35.140 --> 00:07:39.380
You useless physicians
of the Imperial Medical Court!

00:07:40.420 --> 00:07:42.500
If my Mother were still alive,

00:07:43.540 --> 00:07:45.660
my headaches would've been cured long ago!

00:07:50.340 --> 00:07:51.340
Get out!

00:07:51.460 --> 00:07:53.100
All of you, get out of my sight!

00:07:57.540 --> 00:07:58.660
Your Majesty,

00:07:58.820 --> 00:08:01.260
I have found a divine healer hidden
among the people.

00:08:01.540 --> 00:08:03.579
You're afflicted
by a demon's Charm Spell,

00:08:03.580 --> 00:08:05.659
which is why you're so obsessed
with the Empress.

00:08:05.660 --> 00:08:07.220
Nonsense!

00:08:07.300 --> 00:08:08.820
My love for Xin'er

00:08:09.060 --> 00:08:10.579
is true and from the heart!

00:08:10.580 --> 00:08:12.340
It is not true love, Your Majesty.

00:08:12.420 --> 00:08:13.899
It's because you've begun to doubt

00:08:13.900 --> 00:08:15.219
the reality of that love,

00:08:15.220 --> 00:08:16.939
that your head aches so painfully.

00:08:16.940 --> 00:08:18.860
The Charm Spell is tormenting you!

00:08:19.020 --> 00:08:19.979
You...

00:08:19.980 --> 00:08:23.140
If you dare deny my love
for the Empress again,

00:08:23.420 --> 00:08:24.859
I'll kill you!

00:08:24.860 --> 00:08:25.980
Your Majesty!

00:08:27.620 --> 00:08:28.740
Your Majesty!

00:08:29.060 --> 00:08:31.420
I brought two elixirs
from the divine healer.

00:08:31.820 --> 00:08:34.419
The blue one will make you sever
all feelings of love,

00:08:34.420 --> 00:08:35.699
cut every emotional tie

00:08:35.700 --> 00:08:37.339
and cure the headache completely.

00:08:37.340 --> 00:08:39.379
The red one only relieves the pain,

00:08:39.380 --> 00:08:40.660
but cannot heal it.

00:09:02.300 --> 00:09:03.180
Your Majesty.

00:09:03.220 --> 00:09:04.980
What did you give me to drink?

00:09:05.220 --> 00:09:07.740
Why does my head hurt even more?

00:09:08.540 --> 00:09:09.339
Your Majesty.

00:09:09.340 --> 00:09:11.859
Actually, the red one is the potion
to sever love.

00:09:11.860 --> 00:09:13.780
You...

00:09:13.980 --> 00:09:15.940
How dare you deceive me?

00:09:18.700 --> 00:09:21.299
I didn't dare, Your Majesty.
I did it for your own good!

00:09:21.300 --> 00:09:22.219
Only this way

00:09:22.220 --> 00:09:24.179
can your illness truly be cured.

00:09:24.180 --> 00:09:26.780
Only then will the demon's spell
leave your heart!

00:09:27.300 --> 00:09:29.259
I'll kill you!

00:09:29.260 --> 00:09:31.500
I'll kill you!

00:09:33.060 --> 00:09:33.979
(Your Majesty.)

00:09:33.980 --> 00:09:36.380
(You will one day understand
the Former Empress's intentions.)

00:09:40.060 --> 00:09:42.100
So that's all she said?

00:09:43.380 --> 00:09:45.660
That old witch truly is unpredictable.

00:09:45.900 --> 00:09:48.340
After saying just those four lines,
she drove me out.

00:09:48.500 --> 00:09:49.420
Yue,

00:09:49.500 --> 00:09:50.820
what do you think

00:09:51.060 --> 00:09:53.300
she meant by those words?

00:09:54.300 --> 00:09:56.219
Mother and child connected,

00:09:56.220 --> 00:09:58.420
bound through life and death.

00:10:00.340 --> 00:10:02.620
Could it mean

00:10:02.820 --> 00:10:05.940
the parasite is divided
into mother and child worms?

00:10:06.300 --> 00:10:07.739
There are thousands of child worms

00:10:07.740 --> 00:10:09.459
living inside the controlled person.

00:10:09.460 --> 00:10:10.700
And the mother worm

00:10:10.820 --> 00:10:12.740
is held by the controller.

00:10:13.060 --> 00:10:14.740
If the mother worm dies,

00:10:14.980 --> 00:10:16.860
the child worms should vanish too.

00:10:18.580 --> 00:10:20.979
Then what about "love leads to madness"

00:10:20.980 --> 00:10:22.580
and "fate has been defied"?

00:10:26.140 --> 00:10:28.740
Could it mean

00:10:29.260 --> 00:10:31.300
that the controlled one

00:10:31.460 --> 00:10:34.579
deeply loves the controller
who holds the mother worm,

00:10:34.580 --> 00:10:36.420
to the point of losing all reason?

00:10:37.740 --> 00:10:39.580
That's impossible.

00:10:40.020 --> 00:10:41.900
I just can't make sense of it.

00:10:43.500 --> 00:10:44.259
But

00:10:44.260 --> 00:10:45.099
I think

00:10:45.100 --> 00:10:46.379
the time you were cursed

00:10:46.380 --> 00:10:48.899
was probably when you came
from Mount Yao to the palace.

00:10:48.900 --> 00:10:49.979
Think carefully.

00:10:49.980 --> 00:10:52.020
Who approached you back then?

00:10:53.340 --> 00:10:55.620
When I came from Mount Yao
to the palace,

00:10:55.660 --> 00:10:57.260
no one dared to approach me.

00:10:57.620 --> 00:11:00.339
It was said
that the Former Empress Duanmu Jin,

00:11:00.340 --> 00:11:02.620
my Brother's mother gave that order.

00:11:03.100 --> 00:11:04.980
Why would she do that?

00:11:05.820 --> 00:11:07.539
Maybe she feared demons.

00:11:07.540 --> 00:11:09.419
So even until her death,

00:11:09.420 --> 00:11:10.940
we never met.

00:11:11.500 --> 00:11:12.580
But,

00:11:12.740 --> 00:11:14.219
my Brother wasn't afraid.

00:11:14.220 --> 00:11:15.780
He would always sneak to see me,

00:11:16.020 --> 00:11:16.979
and even brought

00:11:16.980 --> 00:11:18.620
my favorite glutinous rice cakes.

00:11:19.260 --> 00:11:20.659
Glutinous rice cakes?

00:11:20.660 --> 00:11:21.780
Mm.

00:11:23.220 --> 00:11:25.580
The parasite larva looks
like glutinous rice.

00:11:27.180 --> 00:11:29.379
It could've been hidden
in those rice cakes!

00:11:29.380 --> 00:11:31.100
Could it be Xiling Heng...

00:11:31.700 --> 00:11:33.020
Impossible.

00:11:33.700 --> 00:11:36.099
He was just a child back then.

00:11:36.100 --> 00:11:38.780
How could a child do such a thing?

00:11:39.180 --> 00:11:40.260
Besides,

00:11:40.380 --> 00:11:42.259
he's always treated me so kindly.

00:11:42.260 --> 00:11:43.459
All these years,

00:11:43.460 --> 00:11:45.580
he's cared for me like a father.

00:11:45.780 --> 00:11:47.660
How could he ever harm me?

00:11:51.060 --> 00:11:52.180
Anyway,

00:11:52.260 --> 00:11:53.660
it can't be him.

00:11:55.300 --> 00:11:57.060
(Yaya is pure by nature,)

00:11:57.220 --> 00:11:59.580
(maybe he hasn't seen
through everything yet.)

00:12:01.100 --> 00:12:03.820
(Since Xiling Heng
often visited him as a child,)

00:12:04.100 --> 00:12:05.620
(even if it wasn't him,)

00:12:05.740 --> 00:12:07.580
(he must've seen something.)

00:12:21.900 --> 00:12:22.899
Your Majesty,

00:12:22.900 --> 00:12:24.380
how do you feel?

00:12:25.740 --> 00:12:27.740
That miracle doctor's medicine

00:12:28.380 --> 00:12:29.860
really works.

00:12:30.220 --> 00:12:31.219
Then, Your Majesty,

00:12:31.220 --> 00:12:33.579
how do you feel now

00:12:33.580 --> 00:12:34.860
when you think of the Empress?

00:12:39.780 --> 00:12:41.179
A mere woman,

00:12:41.180 --> 00:12:42.700
what else could I feel?

00:12:43.020 --> 00:12:45.299
What I want to know now is

00:12:45.300 --> 00:12:48.580
which demon cast that Charm Spell on me?

00:12:48.820 --> 00:12:51.100
Your Majesty,
you're finally clear-headed!

00:12:51.420 --> 00:12:53.259
I've always thought
the Empress was a demon,

00:12:53.260 --> 00:12:55.300
she must be the one who bewitched you.

00:12:55.340 --> 00:12:57.659
But she already drank
the Demon-revealing Potion.

00:12:57.660 --> 00:12:59.259
She didn't show her true form.

00:12:59.260 --> 00:13:01.139
But if she's just a remnant soul

00:13:01.140 --> 00:13:02.979
attached to the Former Empress's body,

00:13:02.980 --> 00:13:04.780
then of course she'd have no form.

00:13:05.340 --> 00:13:06.299
Your Majesty,

00:13:06.300 --> 00:13:08.859
do you still remember
what Lord Yi said?

00:13:08.860 --> 00:13:10.139
The Empress is a demon,

00:13:10.140 --> 00:13:12.060
a remnant soul of a white fox.

00:13:13.380 --> 00:13:14.460
Your Majesty,

00:13:14.500 --> 00:13:16.139
are you saying the Empress?

00:13:16.140 --> 00:13:17.619
She really is a fox demon.

00:13:17.620 --> 00:13:19.819
Your Majesty, she really is a demon!

00:13:19.820 --> 00:13:20.699
Your Majesty,

00:13:20.700 --> 00:13:22.259
this is the fox's body.

00:13:22.260 --> 00:13:24.419
Once her soul returns to it,
you'll understand everything.

00:13:24.420 --> 00:13:26.059
Out of respect for our marriage,

00:13:26.060 --> 00:13:27.460
I'll give you a proper burial.

00:13:27.700 --> 00:13:28.820
Your Majesty.

00:13:29.500 --> 00:13:30.859
I'll listen to you.

00:13:30.860 --> 00:13:31.899
Reward him.

00:13:31.900 --> 00:13:32.939
I'll listen to you.

00:13:32.940 --> 00:13:33.980
Let her go.

00:13:34.140 --> 00:13:35.260
Very well.

00:13:39.380 --> 00:13:40.820
It seems

00:13:41.140 --> 00:13:43.300
I've misunderstood Lord Yi.

00:13:44.100 --> 00:13:45.900
That fox demon

00:13:46.100 --> 00:13:48.340
truly deserves to die.

00:13:49.140 --> 00:13:49.859
Your Majesty.

00:13:49.860 --> 00:13:51.540
The Empress seeks audience.

00:13:55.100 --> 00:13:56.860
Let her in.
