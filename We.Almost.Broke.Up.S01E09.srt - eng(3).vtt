(This is a work of fiction)

00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:01.720
Enjoy, sir.

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:05.320
That's impossible.

00:01:05.520 --> 00:01:07.920
Shen Meng isn't a casual person.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:10.760
How could her heart flutter
for a stranger?

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:13.440
Absolutely impossible.

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:15.760
But I've never seen her like this.

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:19.320
I have.

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:22.360
When?

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:25.800
When she first saw you.

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:27.040
It was love at first sight too,
wasn't it?

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:30.880
Stop thinking about it.
Here, let's have a drink.

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:59.120
(Meeting Point with Shen Meng,
Running Route, Lawn, Central Lake)

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:35.160
Dude.

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:36.400
How old are you?

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:40.800
Hey, are... are you of age?

00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:05.320
Xu Yuan.

00:03:54.320 --> 00:03:55.320
I can do this.

00:03:56.800 --> 00:03:57.880
I can definitely do this.

00:04:03.240 --> 00:04:04.240
Hello.

00:04:06.320 --> 00:04:07.440
Can we have a chat?

00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:14.680
How rude.

00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:29.960
Xu Yuan.

00:04:36.120 --> 00:04:37.120
Shen Meng.

00:04:37.280 --> 00:04:38.280
Shen Meng!

00:04:40.920 --> 00:04:42.520
Wait, don't go!

00:05:04.880 --> 00:05:06.120
It's almost time.

00:05:07.520 --> 00:05:08.920
You won't make it
if you don't leave now.

00:05:11.720 --> 00:05:12.720
Don't bother.

00:05:14.400 --> 00:05:15.600
You can't help me with this.

00:05:15.960 --> 00:05:16.960
Who's helping you?

00:05:17.320 --> 00:05:19.160
I was just passing by yesterday.

00:05:21.920 --> 00:05:23.760
We've already broken up.
It's none of my business.

00:05:35.520 --> 00:05:36.560
Can you do this?

00:05:37.080 --> 00:05:38.080
Don't worry.

00:05:38.280 --> 00:05:40.600
I'll make sure
this is handled well.

00:05:41.320 --> 00:05:42.320
Make the arrangements.

00:05:42.880 --> 00:05:44.760
Can I ask the reason?

00:05:45.080 --> 00:05:46.080
Don't ask silly questions.

00:05:46.160 --> 00:05:47.919
For so many years,

00:05:47.920 --> 00:05:49.480
when have I ever said no to Chen?

00:05:49.920 --> 00:05:52.079
Will he come if it rains?

00:05:52.080 --> 00:05:53.279
What do you mean?

00:05:53.280 --> 00:05:55.240
What if he comes? We'll just wait.

00:05:55.760 --> 00:05:58.040
What if we can't defeat him?

00:05:58.160 --> 00:05:59.519
Who told you to lay a hand on him?

00:05:59.520 --> 00:06:01.679
Chen told us to stop him.

00:06:01.680 --> 00:06:02.919
You must absolutely not touch him.

00:06:02.920 --> 00:06:04.240
What if we can't stop him?

00:06:04.600 --> 00:06:06.520
Why do you two
have so many questions?

00:06:07.760 --> 00:06:08.760
Let me tell you,

00:06:09.120 --> 00:06:10.480
don't panic, okay?

00:06:10.640 --> 00:06:12.120
If it doesn't work out,
we'll just deal with it.

00:06:13.200 --> 00:06:14.200
That's him!

00:06:14.480 --> 00:06:15.480
Stop him!

00:06:21.880 --> 00:06:22.999
This probably can't be
considered stopping him.

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:24.039
Aren't we just running with him?

00:06:24.040 --> 00:06:25.079
Mr. Hu, are you dizzy?

00:06:25.080 --> 00:06:26.160
I'm very dizzy.

00:06:32.480 --> 00:06:33.480
Stop.

00:06:33.600 --> 00:06:34.600
What are you doing?

00:06:41.400 --> 00:06:42.400
Chen Jia Wen!

00:06:42.880 --> 00:06:43.880
What are you doing?

00:07:04.120 --> 00:07:05.120
Aren't you...

00:07:05.480 --> 00:07:06.960
going out today?

00:07:32.280 --> 00:07:33.600
Do you want to know who he is?

00:07:39.360 --> 00:07:40.360
You don't have...

00:07:40.920 --> 00:07:43.960
to tell me if you don't want to.

00:07:44.280 --> 00:07:45.280
His name is Xu Yuan.

00:07:52.920 --> 00:07:54.240
He died in a car accident.

00:08:07.720 --> 00:08:08.720
I can't...

00:08:09.640 --> 00:08:10.680
face him calmly.

00:08:13.040 --> 00:08:14.520
I know he's gone.

00:08:19.480 --> 00:08:20.480
But I really,

00:08:20.680 --> 00:08:22.240
really don't know what to do.

00:08:24.920 --> 00:08:26.360
It's been four years. Why...

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:29.560
Why haven't you mentioned anything?

00:08:34.200 --> 00:08:35.520
It wasn't easy for me
to get over it.

00:08:37.400 --> 00:08:38.560
I never wanted to talk about it.

00:08:45.400 --> 00:08:46.400
I'm sorry.

00:08:56.440 --> 00:08:58.120
If you still have a chance,

00:08:59.400 --> 00:09:00.440
what would you like to tell him?

00:09:02.520 --> 00:09:04.120
It resets as soon as we meet.

00:09:04.480 --> 00:09:05.480
There's no chance at all.

00:09:05.480 --> 00:09:06.480
What if there is?

00:09:09.640 --> 00:09:10.640
Perhaps...

00:09:12.840 --> 00:09:14.080
I'd say goodbye properly.

00:09:23.880 --> 00:09:25.000
Then... then say it.

00:09:26.040 --> 00:09:27.160
Just pretend I'm Xu Yuan.

00:09:28.600 --> 00:09:30.440
Your heart won't flutter
for me now anyway.

00:09:36.440 --> 00:09:37.440
Do you really want to hear it?

00:09:50.840 --> 00:09:51.840
Xu Yuan,

00:09:53.240 --> 00:09:54.240
long time no see.

00:09:55.680 --> 00:09:57.120
I never thought that one day,

00:09:57.600 --> 00:09:58.760
I could see you again.

00:09:59.520 --> 00:10:00.520
I'm really glad.

00:10:01.080 --> 00:10:02.840
Actually, I've always been afraid.

00:10:04.480 --> 00:10:06.720
At first, I was afraid
I wouldn't be able to forget you.

00:10:09.280 --> 00:10:10.600
Later on, I was afraid...

00:10:11.720 --> 00:10:12.760
that I've really forgotten you.

00:10:13.920 --> 00:10:14.920
You know what?

00:10:17.080 --> 00:10:19.360
It's been a long time
since I cried because of you.

00:10:20.360 --> 00:10:22.400
It's like I've never loved you.

00:10:27.840 --> 00:10:29.279
Until you appeared...

00:10:29.280 --> 00:10:30.400
before me like this.

00:10:31.880 --> 00:10:33.080
I tried again and again...

00:10:33.320 --> 00:10:34.320
and confirmed it repeatedly.

00:10:35.600 --> 00:10:37.280
I've confirmed
that my love for you...

00:10:40.640 --> 00:10:41.640
has never...

00:10:44.440 --> 00:10:45.440
disappeared.

00:10:50.840 --> 00:10:52.439
I will continue living...

00:10:52.440 --> 00:10:53.720
with the love I have for you.
