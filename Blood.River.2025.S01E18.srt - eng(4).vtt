So, what's your goal

00:01:42.870 --> 00:01:43.660
for coming here?

[Blood River members involved in the Wushuang City attack: Su Xiemo]

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:53.770
Don't worry.

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:55.490
We came here

00:01:55.510 --> 00:01:56.490
with no goals in mind.

00:01:57.280 --> 00:01:58.380
Xiao Zhaoyan is my younger sister.

00:01:59.000 --> 00:01:59.690
She's here

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:01.850
because I requested the Patriarch

00:02:01.870 --> 00:02:03.380
to send her here back then.

00:02:05.150 --> 00:02:06.180
I see.

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:22.500
If so, I shall not bother you all.

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:23.540
Farewell.

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:37.100
That guy is kind of interesting.

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:39.980
He was a little surprised

00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:41.500
when he found out about our identities.

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:42.820
However,

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:43.850
he wants to

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:45.060
keep a distance from us after that.

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:47.820
The people here

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:48.690
are most terrified of

00:02:48.710 --> 00:02:50.060

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:52.010
There are plenty of retired members

recruit them into Blood River again,

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:00.570
they'll form an unstoppable force.

00:03:01.630 --> 00:03:03.340
Therefore, after he found out about your identities,

00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:05.340
he left immediately upon knowing that you didn't come here

00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:06.260
for him.

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:08.260
If he found out that you guys came to find them,

00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:10.380
we would've been in some trouble.

00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:16.100
Let's drop the topic.

00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:18.610
Didn't you say that we would enjoy meat and liquor

00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:19.680
every meal?

00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:20.690
Where's the meat?

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:21.660
Where's the liquor?

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:24.170
This is our homemade rice wine.

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:24.980
It's very strong.

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:25.690
Do you dare to drink it?

00:03:27.960 --> 00:03:28.820

[Flying Tiger General's Residence]

00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:43.290
Since you dare to seek an audience with me

at Uncle's residence in the middle of the day,

00:03:46.240 --> 00:03:47.340
does that mean

00:03:47.630 --> 00:03:48.940
you've persuaded the Three Families successfully?

00:03:50.190 --> 00:03:50.570
Indeed.

00:03:51.870 --> 00:03:52.690
Your Highness,

00:03:52.910 --> 00:03:54.450
Grandfather and the rest have agreed to join hands with you.

00:03:57.120 --> 00:03:57.780
Excellent.

00:03:58.750 --> 00:03:59.850
A wise man adapts himself

00:04:00.310 --> 00:04:01.340
to the changing times.

00:04:01.910 --> 00:04:03.450
Yi Bu wouldn't have ended up like this

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:05.940
had he understood the meaning of that line.

00:04:07.630 --> 00:04:08.340
As for you,

00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:10.730
you made the right decision.

00:04:11.630 --> 00:04:12.690
Since young,

00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:14.450
it felt strange to me

00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:16.050
that the Shadow Guards

00:04:16.070 --> 00:04:17.100
could come and go at will

00:04:18.040 --> 00:04:19.050
while the Three Families

00:04:19.600 --> 00:04:21.660
could only keep watch over Wanjuan Tower,

00:04:22.390 --> 00:04:23.100
and become the bodyguards

00:04:23.870 --> 00:04:25.660
of Yi Bu's Shadow Sect.

00:04:29.190 --> 00:04:30.900
Until the day I saw Su Muyu.

00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:32.460
That's when I understood

00:04:32.480 --> 00:04:34.170
why I had to endure defiance and unwillingness

00:04:34.830 --> 00:04:36.050
all these years

00:04:39.160 --> 00:04:40.490
Su Muyu was unhappy about

00:04:40.510 --> 00:04:41.730
being the shadow of the Shadow Sect.

00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:43.730
Does he think that I'm happy about that?

00:04:44.630 --> 00:04:45.780
Grandfather and the rest may have been old,

00:04:46.160 --> 00:04:47.340
but I'm still young.

00:04:48.040 --> 00:04:48.850
The younger generations

00:04:48.870 --> 00:04:50.610
are brave enough to carve a new world out of the old.

00:04:51.190 --> 00:04:52.170
Your Highness,

00:04:52.870 --> 00:04:54.140
I'm willing to be your arrow.

00:04:54.600 --> 00:04:56.340
On the day you release it,

00:04:56.830 --> 00:04:58.700
once you help me make a name for myself,

00:04:59.510 --> 00:05:01.410
by then, we can see

00:05:01.830 --> 00:05:03.980
whether or not Su Muyu of the martial world is stronger

00:05:04.630 --> 00:05:06.290
than our forces

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:07.660
in the imperial palace.

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:10.700
Excellent.

00:05:12.270 --> 00:05:12.900
Very good.

00:05:14.310 --> 00:05:14.780
By the way,

00:05:16.120 --> 00:05:16.700
on that night,

00:05:17.120 --> 00:05:18.490
I assume they've retrieved the letter

00:05:19.070 --> 00:05:20.410
that belonged

00:05:21.310 --> 00:05:22.460
to their own compartments, right?

00:05:23.630 --> 00:05:24.250
They have.

00:05:26.040 --> 00:05:26.700
Excellent.

00:05:27.310 --> 00:05:28.410
After Blood River selected a new leader,

00:05:29.040 --> 00:05:29.810
Yi Bu ordered his men

00:05:29.830 --> 00:05:31.410
to retrieve everything in the compartment.

00:05:32.390 --> 00:05:33.490
Your Highness, did you feed them

00:05:33.510 --> 00:05:34.410
with false information?

00:05:35.240 --> 00:05:35.660
No.

00:05:36.480 --> 00:05:37.490
Of course they're true.

00:05:38.390 --> 00:05:39.140
It might even be

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:41.540
more detailed

00:05:42.070 --> 00:05:43.460
than the original document.

00:05:44.480 --> 00:05:46.810
It's because I bought the information

00:05:46.830 --> 00:05:48.540
from Baixiao Hall many years ago.

00:05:49.830 --> 00:05:51.220
Back then, Baixiao Hall

00:05:52.190 --> 00:05:53.050
was still untainted

00:05:53.070 --> 00:05:54.780
by the forces of Prince of Langya.

00:05:56.190 --> 00:05:57.580
Your Highness, why are you helping them out?

00:05:59.830 --> 00:06:01.140
It's because it'll be their turn

00:06:02.870 --> 00:06:04.580
to help me out soon.

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:08.540
Ms. Yumo.

00:06:10.040 --> 00:06:11.020
Please help me keep an eye on

00:06:11.190 --> 00:06:12.220
the movements of Tianqi's Xuanwu Guardian.

00:06:13.720 --> 00:06:14.730
We had a promise.

00:06:15.270 --> 00:06:16.610
But when I visited the Inner Security Division yesterday,

00:06:16.950 --> 00:06:17.810
their men said

00:06:18.190 --> 00:06:19.370
that they hadn't seen him around for a long time.

00:06:20.480 --> 00:06:21.410
If you receive any news of him

00:06:22.070 --> 00:06:22.780
returning to Tianqi,

00:06:23.190 --> 00:06:24.100
please notify me immediately.

00:06:27.920 --> 00:06:28.250
Yes, ma'am.

00:06:38.750 --> 00:06:40.250
He has never gotten drunk?

00:06:40.480 --> 00:06:42.100
He fell unconscious just after one bowl.

00:06:44.830 --> 00:06:46.340
Changhe has a mystical ability.

00:06:46.870 --> 00:06:48.490
When he wants to get drunk, one cup is enough.

00:06:48.720 --> 00:06:49.700
But when he wants to stay sober,

00:06:50.070 --> 00:06:51.490
he won't get drunk

00:06:51.510 --> 00:06:52.100
no matter

00:06:52.720 --> 00:06:53.980
how much liquor he drinks.

00:06:54.480 --> 00:06:55.520
If so, why did he choose

00:06:55.600 --> 00:06:56.980
to get drunk so early tonight?

00:06:58.120 --> 00:06:58.850
It's because he knows

00:07:00.070 --> 00:07:00.700
that I have some private matters

00:07:01.720 --> 00:07:02.700
to tell you.

00:07:03.070 --> 00:07:03.660
What is it?

00:07:21.920 --> 00:07:23.490
I found some past secrets

00:07:25.390 --> 00:07:26.810
in Tianqi City's Wanjuan Tower.

00:07:28.720 --> 00:07:29.660
I also found out

00:07:29.680 --> 00:07:30.540
about the identity of the culprit

00:07:32.480 --> 00:07:34.100
who wiped out No-Sword City back then.

00:07:35.190 --> 00:07:35.930
Who was it?

00:07:37.680 --> 00:07:38.340
It was Blood River.

00:07:40.750 --> 00:07:41.850
Is that true?

00:07:45.390 --> 00:07:46.050
Back then,

00:07:47.510 --> 00:07:49.050
Blood River sent out 93 of their members

00:07:49.070 --> 00:07:49.900
as per the order.

00:07:51.310 --> 00:07:52.410
Together with

00:07:52.430 --> 00:07:53.730
several of Zhou Yuluo's personal disciples,

00:07:54.950 --> 00:07:56.540
they caused The Uprising of No-Sword City.

00:08:01.360 --> 00:08:02.490
Zhou Yuluo's family

00:08:02.510 --> 00:08:03.340
had a total of 67 members.

00:08:06.870 --> 00:08:08.580
Only their young lord, who was still a child, survived.

00:08:11.390 --> 00:08:12.460
He escaped along the river.

00:08:13.920 --> 00:08:14.900
He was captured by Blood River.

00:08:18.680 --> 00:08:20.660
The young lord of No-Sword City was born with an affinity for swords.

00:08:22.360 --> 00:08:24.220
The head of the Su family coveted his talent.

00:08:24.750 --> 00:08:26.290
Thus, he arranged for him to enter the Furnace.

00:08:27.310 --> 00:08:28.660
He nurtured him as a Nameless

00:08:30.480 --> 00:08:32.340
so that he could serve the Su family in the future.

00:08:36.150 --> 00:08:37.340
Blood River?

00:08:41.150 --> 00:08:41.650
Indeed.

00:08:45.270 --> 00:08:47.100
The culprit that I've been searching for,

00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:51.610
it's actually the place

00:08:51.630 --> 00:08:52.820
I grew up in.

00:08:58.790 --> 00:08:59.820
There were 93 assassins

00:09:00.750 --> 00:09:01.580
dispatched for duty.

00:09:02.320 --> 00:09:03.580
18 of them survived.

00:09:06.390 --> 00:09:07.650
I reviewed the name list.

00:09:09.150 --> 00:09:10.340
I know none of them.

00:09:11.510 --> 00:09:12.580
It's because they were murdered

00:09:12.600 --> 00:09:13.700
in the middle of their missions

00:09:13.720 --> 00:09:14.460
after the incident.

00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:16.700
You can take a look.

00:10:28.670 --> 00:10:29.490
the entire village

00:10:30.790 --> 00:10:31.770
just after I said that

00:10:31.790 --> 00:10:32.370
this was my home yesterday.

00:10:34.360 --> 00:10:35.220
Where does Su Xiemo live?

00:10:36.360 --> 00:10:37.010
The third house

00:10:37.360 --> 00:10:37.940
from the village entrance.

00:10:39.030 --> 00:10:39.530
All right.

00:10:42.440 --> 00:10:42.980
Please be careful.

00:11:14.440 --> 00:11:15.370
Senior, you're in a great mood, huh?

00:11:16.750 --> 00:11:17.890
It's been a habit of mine for many years.

00:11:19.120 --> 00:11:20.130
Enjoying a vat of wine

00:11:21.440 --> 00:11:22.770
and a plate of peanuts

00:11:24.630 --> 00:11:25.650
is the only

00:11:26.440 --> 00:11:27.370
enjoyable moment

00:11:27.870 --> 00:11:28.890
of my day.

00:11:31.600 --> 00:11:32.220
I understand.

00:11:34.720 --> 00:11:36.250
I figured out who you were

00:11:38.150 --> 00:11:39.580
after our first encounter.

00:11:40.720 --> 00:11:41.770
You resemble

00:11:42.480 --> 00:11:43.420
the younger version of your father

00:11:44.910 --> 00:11:46.060
a lot.

00:11:47.630 --> 00:11:49.220
My swordsmanship

00:11:49.240 --> 00:11:49.940
is also

00:11:51.720 --> 00:11:52.890
on par with his.

00:11:56.360 --> 00:11:57.130
Is your umbrella

00:11:58.390 --> 00:11:59.250
your sword?

00:12:18.390 --> 00:12:20.130
I keep 18 swords in my umbrella.

00:12:22.120 --> 00:12:23.130
And, there are a total of

00:12:23.150 --> 00:12:24.060
18 people here.

00:12:25.080 --> 00:12:26.130
Just nice. One sword

00:12:27.440 --> 00:12:29.010
for each of you.

00:12:37.080 --> 00:12:38.490
I can tell why the head of the Su family

00:12:39.440 --> 00:12:41.010
took a liking to you immediately.

00:12:42.840 --> 00:12:44.730
I can't believe that someone picked up the Eighteen-Sword Array.

00:12:46.960 --> 00:12:47.610
All of you

00:12:47.630 --> 00:12:48.610
were supposed to be dead.

00:12:49.790 --> 00:12:51.650
Why are all of you in the Homeland?

00:12:53.190 --> 00:12:54.220
Back then, Soul Reapers' Hall

00:12:54.240 --> 00:12:55.170
gave us this mission.

00:12:56.630 --> 00:12:58.400
At first, the Patriarch refused to accept it.

00:13:00.160 --> 00:13:01.690
The eradication of No-Sword City

00:13:01.720 --> 00:13:03.330
would bring a huge impact.

00:13:05.630 --> 00:13:07.100
It would shake the foundation of Blood River.

00:13:09.200 --> 00:13:11.100
However, the Soul Reapers' Hall was very adamant about it.

00:13:12.790 --> 00:13:14.730
Due to that, Blood River suffered heavy casualties.

00:13:16.240 --> 00:13:18.430
Out of 93 expert assassins who were dispatched,

00:13:19.270 --> 00:13:21.220
only 18 of them survived.

00:13:24.200 --> 00:13:25.220
And, these 18 survivors

00:13:25.630 --> 00:13:27.580
were hunted and pursued

00:13:30.030 --> 00:13:31.060
during

00:13:31.960 --> 00:13:32.650
their missions.

00:13:35.720 --> 00:13:37.010
No one could find out about the mission

00:13:37.030 --> 00:13:38.700
Blood River would accept in advance.

00:13:40.390 --> 00:13:41.060
Except for

00:13:44.080 --> 00:13:45.010
the Soul Reapers' Hall.

00:13:45.910 --> 00:13:46.420
Indeed.

00:13:48.030 --> 00:13:49.250
The Patriarch also suspected

00:13:50.270 --> 00:13:53.220
that Soul Reapers' Hall and the one who placed the order

00:13:54.630 --> 00:13:55.730
wanted to silence us.

00:13:59.790 --> 00:14:01.460
The art of silencing people

00:14:01.670 --> 00:14:03.490
never existed in Blood River.

00:14:04.120 --> 00:14:05.250
It's because you guys have no information

00:14:05.270 --> 00:14:06.300
about your employers.

00:14:07.550 --> 00:14:08.940
There's no need to silence them.

00:14:09.840 --> 00:14:10.580
But that time

00:14:11.600 --> 00:14:12.180
was different.

00:14:14.030 --> 00:14:15.130
The employer desired

00:14:16.120 --> 00:14:17.580
the precious sword manuals

00:14:17.600 --> 00:14:18.700
of No-Sword City.

00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:21.100
On the night our men

00:14:21.120 --> 00:14:22.370
charged into the city,

00:14:22.870 --> 00:14:24.700
some of their men who had infiltrated the city

00:14:24.910 --> 00:14:25.980
were fighting for

00:14:26.440 --> 00:14:27.890
the sword manuals.

00:14:29.120 --> 00:14:30.570
And for a brief moment,

00:14:31.080 --> 00:14:32.460
our two forces

00:14:33.240 --> 00:14:34.700
clashed by mistake.

00:14:35.840 --> 00:14:37.850
It was during the clash

00:14:38.550 --> 00:14:39.580
that I figured out

00:14:40.480 --> 00:14:41.850
the sword techniques they were using.

00:14:47.360 --> 00:14:48.700
Riding the sword to the Ninth Heaven...

00:14:51.750 --> 00:14:53.300
As the dragon falls into the Yellow Springs.

00:14:53.720 --> 00:14:54.180
That's right.

00:14:55.670 --> 00:14:56.770
It was the Ninth Heaven Sword Technique.

00:14:58.510 --> 00:14:59.300
Wushuang City?

00:15:04.910 --> 00:15:05.580
Calm down.

00:15:09.750 --> 00:15:10.730
Once this technique is used,

00:15:12.630 --> 00:15:13.700
every other sword technique will pale in comparison.

00:15:16.240 --> 00:15:17.980
However, the strongest city in the world

00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:18.700
with an unparalleled reputation,

00:15:20.480 --> 00:15:22.370
also made a name for itself due to its sword techniques.

00:15:26.480 --> 00:15:27.250
Wushuang City, huh?

00:15:30.120 --> 00:15:32.100
That answer chills my heart.

00:15:34.960 --> 00:15:35.820
Why do you say so?

00:15:38.550 --> 00:15:39.580
It's because my father

00:15:39.960 --> 00:15:41.580
once complimented the swordsmanship

00:15:41.600 --> 00:15:43.130
of Liu Yunqi, the former lord of Wushuang City.

00:15:45.390 --> 00:15:47.060
He felt a faint sense of kinship toward him.

00:15:49.270 --> 00:15:50.060
What a shame.

00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:52.650
Mr. Su,

00:15:54.480 --> 00:15:55.340
I've already told you

00:15:56.270 --> 00:15:57.420
everything I know.

00:15:58.910 --> 00:16:00.060
But there are certain things

00:16:00.960 --> 00:16:01.820
I wish to tell you.

00:16:02.670 --> 00:16:03.650
There's no emotional bond

00:16:04.270 --> 00:16:05.770
between you and us.

00:16:06.960 --> 00:16:09.060
We don't feel any guilt at all.

00:16:10.510 --> 00:16:11.850
Blood River was just following orders.

00:16:12.840 --> 00:16:13.650
It's the same for you.

00:16:17.510 --> 00:16:18.250
Therefore,

00:16:19.550 --> 00:16:21.250
if you wish to seek revenge,

00:16:24.390 --> 00:16:25.770
we'll surely kill you.

00:16:31.670 --> 00:16:32.610
Even if I wish to seek revenge,

00:16:34.030 --> 00:16:35.610
I should seek the culprit behind everything.

00:16:36.750 --> 00:16:37.650
I understand that.

00:16:38.960 --> 00:16:39.730
Moreover,

00:16:41.670 --> 00:16:42.530
after joining the Homeland,

00:16:45.150 --> 00:16:47.370
all of your honors and sins will be washed away.

00:16:48.670 --> 00:16:50.370
That will never change.

00:17:00.200 --> 00:17:00.820
Master Su.

00:17:03.000 --> 00:17:03.530
Thank you.

00:17:06.880 --> 00:17:07.900
It's been many years

00:17:08.590 --> 00:17:09.490
since

00:17:09.510 --> 00:17:10.660
we wielded a sword.

00:17:11.790 --> 00:17:13.050
Now, we're better at using hoes

00:17:14.070 --> 00:17:14.900
compared to

00:17:15.480 --> 00:17:16.380
swords.

00:17:19.480 --> 00:17:19.940
Farewell.

00:17:27.310 --> 00:17:27.700
Sir.

00:17:28.440 --> 00:17:29.050
Why are you scared of him?

00:17:29.830 --> 00:17:30.530
We have plenty of people here.

00:17:30.790 --> 00:17:31.860
I'm sure we can kill a brat like him.

00:17:33.400 --> 00:17:34.810
I'm afraid we can't.

00:17:36.070 --> 00:17:37.250
The Eighteen-Sword Array

00:17:37.960 --> 00:17:39.220
is no joke, you know?

00:17:41.960 --> 00:17:42.860
Moreover...

00:17:50.030 --> 00:17:50.460
Sir.

00:17:51.440 --> 00:17:52.380
Since when was he here?

00:17:52.830 --> 00:17:53.770
He's been here for a long time.

00:17:54.790 --> 00:17:56.010
Just now, when we showed up,

00:17:56.790 --> 00:17:57.380
that guy outside

00:17:57.400 --> 00:17:58.290
has already released his killing intent.

00:17:59.350 --> 00:18:00.290
If we attack him,

00:18:01.550 --> 00:18:02.620
he would surely rush into the room.

00:18:03.270 --> 00:18:05.630
He's the current Patriarch of Blood River,

00:18:06.550 --> 00:18:07.490
Su Changhe.

00:18:08.030 --> 00:18:08.810
Su Changhe, huh?

00:18:10.480 --> 00:18:11.250
Interesting.

00:18:12.510 --> 00:18:13.900
So, what's the aura surrounding him?

00:18:14.640 --> 00:18:15.810
He cultivated Hell Palm.

00:18:16.510 --> 00:18:17.860
- Hell Palm? - Hell Palm?

00:18:19.830 --> 00:18:20.660
I heard

00:18:21.200 --> 00:18:22.620
that it was a cursed art.

00:18:23.350 --> 00:18:25.250
Patriarchs who cultivated the art

00:18:25.960 --> 00:18:26.770
would have a tragic end.

00:18:27.510 --> 00:18:28.980
I don't believe in that type of saying.

00:18:30.200 --> 00:18:31.410
It's because most people like us

00:18:31.910 --> 00:18:33.300
have a tragic end.

00:18:33.990 --> 00:18:35.060
That's why it's making it

00:18:36.040 --> 00:18:36.850
as if

00:18:36.870 --> 00:18:38.490
every Patriarch who cultivated the art

00:18:39.480 --> 00:18:40.410
would have a tragic end.

00:18:42.640 --> 00:18:43.380
What are you doing here?

00:18:43.920 --> 00:18:44.940
Didn't I tell you not to come?

00:18:45.590 --> 00:18:46.570
I was drunk.

00:18:47.440 --> 00:18:47.940
I didn't hear what you said.

00:18:50.030 --> 00:18:51.570
Didn't I tell Zhaoyan to relay the message to you?

00:18:52.830 --> 00:18:54.570
Why should I listen to a lass like her?

00:18:56.070 --> 00:18:57.620
But since you don't intend to kill them,

00:18:58.070 --> 00:18:59.250
let's head to Nan'an tomorrow.

00:19:00.960 --> 00:19:01.810
What's with the sudden trip

00:19:02.240 --> 00:19:02.900
to Nan'an?

00:19:03.480 --> 00:19:04.660
I just received some news.

00:19:05.000 --> 00:19:06.380
Your beloved told us to go there and have some fun.

00:19:10.400 --> 00:19:11.180
Tell me the original message.

00:19:14.700 --> 00:19:15.700
[To Su Muyu]

00:19:19.030 --> 00:19:19.620
Su,

00:19:19.880 --> 00:19:20.570
may this letter find you well.

00:19:21.240 --> 00:19:22.570
I've returned to Nan'an City recently,

00:19:22.590 --> 00:19:23.780
and I wish to reopen my apothecary.

00:19:23.880 --> 00:19:26.220
Now, we have enough physicians.

00:19:26.400 --> 00:19:28.460
But we lack an apprentice to grind the herbs or tend to our guests.

00:19:29.070 --> 00:19:30.900
Muyu, I wonder if you're in the mood

00:19:30.920 --> 00:19:32.010
to work for us temporarily.

00:19:33.270 --> 00:19:35.200
It's fine even if you're busy.

00:19:35.480 --> 00:19:36.330
But remember this.

00:19:37.400 --> 00:19:39.420
Do not bring Changhe with you?

00:19:41.590 --> 00:19:42.660
I'm the only one he invited.

00:19:43.200 --> 00:19:43.900
Who said it was us?

00:19:44.830 --> 00:19:45.220
You!

00:19:46.830 --> 00:19:47.420
Just tell me.

00:19:48.070 --> 00:19:48.810
Will you head there or not?

00:19:51.160 --> 00:19:51.660
I guess.

00:19:52.510 --> 00:19:53.250
As for you,

00:19:54.510 --> 00:19:55.180
you should join me too.

00:19:57.160 --> 00:19:58.180
Could it be that you haven't received

00:19:58.400 --> 00:19:59.050
any useful news from them

00:19:59.070 --> 00:20:00.090
as of yet?

00:20:01.590 --> 00:20:02.460
What do you think?

00:20:08.260 --> 00:20:11.060
[Heyu Apothecary]

00:20:16.590 --> 00:20:17.940
A life like this

00:20:18.510 --> 00:20:19.900
is wonderful indeed.

00:20:23.750 --> 00:20:25.330
The incident with Blood River has been resolved.

00:20:25.750 --> 00:20:27.940
Don't you think you should think about

00:20:27.960 --> 00:20:29.140
your marriage now?

00:20:29.960 --> 00:20:30.700
Fadog!

00:20:30.960 --> 00:20:32.140
You're starting to spout nonsense again.

00:20:39.310 --> 00:20:40.460
I think Su Muyu

00:20:40.790 --> 00:20:41.900
is a great candidate.

00:20:44.310 --> 00:20:45.420
Among the people of Blood River,

00:20:45.750 --> 00:20:46.770
I like him the most.

00:20:49.640 --> 00:20:50.290
But you see,

00:20:50.440 --> 00:20:51.770
I don't like his type.

00:20:52.720 --> 00:20:53.940
He's too cold.

00:20:54.510 --> 00:20:55.220
He feels

00:20:55.510 --> 00:20:56.660
boring.

00:20:59.400 --> 00:21:01.420
Perhaps most of the women out there

00:21:01.790 --> 00:21:02.770
would like a guy like him.

00:21:03.270 --> 00:21:04.570
He has a gentle personality.

00:21:05.030 --> 00:21:05.490
And,

00:21:05.920 --> 00:21:07.380
he's good-looking.

00:21:09.110 --> 00:21:10.570
But...

00:21:11.200 --> 00:21:11.900
But what?

00:21:12.590 --> 00:21:13.730
But I prefer

00:21:13.750 --> 00:21:14.490
people who are interesting.

00:21:15.350 --> 00:21:16.290
For example,

00:21:17.240 --> 00:21:18.530
a person like Su Changhe.

00:21:22.270 --> 00:21:23.980
He's the Patriarch of Blood River.

00:21:24.550 --> 00:21:25.780
He's as strong as you can get.

00:21:25.780 --> 00:21:27.090
He has all the power he wants.

00:21:27.830 --> 00:21:28.570
And,

00:21:29.160 --> 00:21:29.660
he is

00:21:30.110 --> 00:21:30.980
very interesting.

00:21:31.440 --> 00:21:32.290
His manner of speech

00:21:32.550 --> 00:21:34.010
is very unique.

00:21:34.680 --> 00:21:37.010
He's a special man.

00:21:39.480 --> 00:21:40.730
That brat...

00:21:41.310 --> 00:21:42.220
You brat...

00:21:47.310 --> 00:21:47.810
Fadog.

00:21:48.720 --> 00:21:50.380
Where are you going?

00:21:51.400 --> 00:21:52.220
I cannot kill you.

00:21:52.510 --> 00:21:53.380
You're my daughter.

00:21:54.720 --> 00:21:55.700
However, I can choose to kill

00:21:55.720 --> 00:21:56.460
that brat, Su Changhe.

00:21:56.680 --> 00:21:57.380
Wait here.

00:21:57.480 --> 00:21:58.050
I'll return soon.

00:21:59.200 --> 00:22:00.810
He's the Patriarch of Blood River, you know?

00:22:01.310 --> 00:22:02.140
Su Muyu

00:22:02.310 --> 00:22:04.420
is just the head of the Su family.

00:22:04.830 --> 00:22:05.770
Fadog,

00:22:06.000 --> 00:22:07.180
why do you like Su Muyu that much?

00:22:07.720 --> 00:22:10.620
And, why do you hate Su Changhe that much?

00:22:11.830 --> 00:22:13.180
I know Su Changhe

00:22:13.400 --> 00:22:14.180
is powerful.

00:22:14.440 --> 00:22:15.700
But he's full of sinister thoughts.

00:22:16.440 --> 00:22:17.290
If you do marry him,

00:22:17.510 --> 00:22:18.770
it's fine if he bullies you.

00:22:19.000 --> 00:22:20.420
But I don't want you to be a widow.

00:22:21.550 --> 00:22:22.290
You see, heroes

00:22:22.440 --> 00:22:23.490
are often misunderstood

00:22:23.510 --> 00:22:25.700
by commoners like you.

00:22:27.240 --> 00:22:29.490
You see,

00:22:29.680 --> 00:22:31.010
Changhe is...

00:22:31.240 --> 00:22:32.140
Miss Bai,

00:22:32.270 --> 00:22:32.810
I never expected you

00:22:32.830 --> 00:22:33.980
to like me that much.

00:22:34.350 --> 00:22:35.810
You must be kidding me.

00:22:43.480 --> 00:22:45.050
Miss Bai, I fancy you as well.

00:22:47.400 --> 00:22:48.530
Why are you here instead?

00:22:49.000 --> 00:22:50.250
Who is it you wish to see, then?

00:23:00.920 --> 00:23:02.330
Who is this?

00:23:03.920 --> 00:23:04.940
She's the woman

00:23:04.960 --> 00:23:06.380
Su Muyu cares for the most.

00:23:06.750 --> 00:23:07.660
She's Su Muyu's

00:23:07.680 --> 00:23:09.330
childhood sweetheart.

00:23:09.680 --> 00:23:10.620
She's Xiao Zhaoyan.

00:23:10.770 --> 00:23:12.050
She comes from Blood River's Homeland.

00:23:15.830 --> 00:23:16.380
We're heading to Nan'an.

00:23:17.400 --> 00:23:18.220
There's a miracle physician there.

00:23:18.920 --> 00:23:20.570
And, she lacks an apprentice to grind her medicine for her.

00:23:22.310 --> 00:23:23.050
So,

00:23:23.240 --> 00:23:25.380
the person Su Muyu misses often,

00:23:25.550 --> 00:23:26.730
the member from the Homeland,

00:23:27.200 --> 00:23:28.330
it's you, Ms. Xiao.

00:23:29.440 --> 00:23:31.380
Greetings, Miss Bai. I'm Younger Sister Xiao.

00:23:31.830 --> 00:23:32.770
Younger sister?

00:23:33.750 --> 00:23:34.900
Does that mean

00:23:35.240 --> 00:23:37.180
she's younger than me?

00:23:37.790 --> 00:23:38.570
Someone's feeling a little sensitive.

00:23:39.960 --> 00:23:41.530
Someone's feeling a little sensitive, huh?

00:23:42.440 --> 00:23:44.730
Lass, you're not eloquent at all.

00:23:45.310 --> 00:23:46.900
Miss Bai is merely 30 years old.

00:23:47.200 --> 00:23:48.530
How could you address her as such?

00:23:49.680 --> 00:23:50.650
You should address her as...

00:23:50.680 --> 00:23:51.180
Fadog!

00:23:51.680 --> 00:23:52.050
Yes, my girl.

00:23:52.440 --> 00:23:53.220
Kill him!

00:23:54.200 --> 00:23:54.620
Roger that!

00:23:56.160 --> 00:23:56.660
No escape for you!

00:23:58.070 --> 00:23:58.570
Uncle Zhe!

00:23:59.160 --> 00:23:59.660
Calm down!

00:24:00.000 --> 00:24:00.490
You can't hit me!

00:24:01.480 --> 00:24:02.380
Ms. Xiao,

00:24:03.000 --> 00:24:03.940
since you're here,

00:24:04.590 --> 00:24:05.570
where's Su Muyu?

00:24:06.200 --> 00:24:07.090
Muyu said

00:24:07.110 --> 00:24:08.490
that he had to visit someone.

00:24:08.510 --> 00:24:09.700
Therefore, he didn't come with us.

00:24:10.070 --> 00:24:10.980
But he'll arrive soon after.

00:24:11.480 --> 00:24:12.330
Visit someone?

00:24:36.070 --> 00:24:37.010
You've been following me the entire way.

00:24:42.160 --> 00:24:43.490
I'm not that free.

00:24:44.000 --> 00:24:45.530
My subordinate was the one following you.

00:24:45.920 --> 00:24:46.490
Master Su.

00:24:47.310 --> 00:24:47.900
Master Ji.

00:24:49.350 --> 00:24:50.380
Why did you

00:24:51.070 --> 00:24:51.900
arrange for this meeting?

00:24:53.160 --> 00:24:54.810
Master Su, did you take anything related to Baixiao Hall

00:24:55.070 --> 00:24:56.050
away from

00:24:56.070 --> 00:24:57.730
Imperial Father-in-Law's Residence?

00:24:58.240 --> 00:24:58.730
If you did,

00:24:59.310 --> 00:25:00.330
that'd prove

00:25:00.750 --> 00:25:02.420
that my long trip

00:25:02.750 --> 00:25:03.660
wasn't in vain.

00:25:07.790 --> 00:25:08.770
Master Ji,

00:25:08.790 --> 00:25:10.250
your words are still as profound as always.

00:25:11.960 --> 00:25:12.810
Is it profound?

00:25:13.480 --> 00:25:14.290
I thought

00:25:14.830 --> 00:25:17.330
I'd already made it obvious enough.

00:25:18.720 --> 00:25:19.460
Did that young archer

00:25:19.480 --> 00:25:21.090
of the Xie family tell you about that?

00:25:21.350 --> 00:25:22.980
I make my own judgments.

00:25:26.920 --> 00:25:28.700
Master Ji, have you been to Wanjuan Tower before?

00:25:29.920 --> 00:25:30.980
I've heard about it.

00:25:31.640 --> 00:25:32.570
Within Wanjuan Tower

00:25:33.350 --> 00:25:34.420
contains Blood River,

00:25:35.310 --> 00:25:36.460
the Free Wind Sect,

00:25:36.720 --> 00:25:37.290
and...

00:25:37.310 --> 00:25:38.730
Baixiao Hall.

00:25:39.510 --> 00:25:41.980
Our Baixiao Hall is known as the All-Knowing under Heaven.

00:25:42.270 --> 00:25:44.050
We've never held Wanjuan Tower in high regard.

00:25:44.440 --> 00:25:46.380
However, for some reason, Wanjuan Tower

00:25:46.790 --> 00:25:48.900
contains information related to Baixiao Hall.

00:25:49.510 --> 00:25:51.460
It would've been fine if the document had been burned down.

00:25:51.920 --> 00:25:52.810
If someone intends to keep it,

00:25:53.510 --> 00:25:56.810
no one shall gain access to it.

00:25:57.240 --> 00:25:58.530
Among all the shelves,

00:25:58.550 --> 00:25:59.900
Baixiao Hall has the fewest books and scrolls.

00:26:05.640 --> 00:26:06.490
This is the only book

00:26:08.480 --> 00:26:10.050
I've retrieved from Wanjuan Tower.

00:26:10.500 --> 00:26:12.740
[Baixiao Hall]

00:26:13.000 --> 00:26:14.050
I haven't read it yet.

00:26:15.550 --> 00:26:17.530
Master Su, you're a smart man.

00:26:17.830 --> 00:26:18.730
Luckily,

00:26:18.750 --> 00:26:19.570
we aren't foes yet.

00:26:20.350 --> 00:26:21.460
If, one day,

00:26:21.720 --> 00:26:22.770
Baixiao Hall and Blood River

00:26:22.790 --> 00:26:23.900
turn into foes,

00:26:24.400 --> 00:26:24.900
I suppose

00:26:25.200 --> 00:26:26.220
you will be

00:26:26.480 --> 00:26:28.010
the first person

00:26:28.350 --> 00:26:30.220
I have to kill.

00:26:44.880 --> 00:26:46.010
I'm showing you this book

00:26:47.510 --> 00:26:48.380
not because I intend to make you

00:26:48.400 --> 00:26:49.700
owe me a favor.

00:26:50.200 --> 00:26:51.460
After all, it would never have existed

00:26:51.830 --> 00:26:53.140
had I allowed it

00:26:53.550 --> 00:26:54.730
to be burned down in a fire.

00:26:56.550 --> 00:26:57.290
I'm showing it to you

00:26:57.750 --> 00:26:58.700
because I found out

00:26:58.720 --> 00:27:00.570
that the paper of the letter contained in the compartment

00:27:02.270 --> 00:27:03.530
was new.

00:27:05.160 --> 00:27:06.980
I once intended to buy some intel from Baixiao Hall.

00:27:07.750 --> 00:27:08.900
According to them,

00:27:09.590 --> 00:27:11.420
that piece of intel would cause an uproar in the martial world.

00:27:13.200 --> 00:27:14.220
Therefore, they couldn't sell it to me.

00:27:14.790 --> 00:27:15.810
Master Ji, I just want you

00:27:16.440 --> 00:27:17.980
to review the piece of intel that I've received.

00:27:19.200 --> 00:27:20.250
You just need to tell me

00:27:21.480 --> 00:27:21.900
whether it's real

00:27:23.750 --> 00:27:24.810
or fake.

00:27:39.110 --> 00:27:39.770
All right.

00:27:48.660 --> 00:27:50.700
[Wushuang City launched an attack, Blood River sent ninety-three assassins]

00:27:50.700 --> 00:27:51.700
[Eighteen survived]

00:27:56.400 --> 00:27:56.980
It's real.

00:27:59.680 --> 00:28:00.180
Thank you.

00:28:02.070 --> 00:28:03.810
Someone stole this document

00:28:04.110 --> 00:28:05.620
from Baixiao Hall.

00:28:06.160 --> 00:28:08.180
After that, they wrote a new one

00:28:08.200 --> 00:28:08.900
and replaced it.

00:28:09.640 --> 00:28:11.010
I've seen plenty of switch-outs before.

00:28:11.270 --> 00:28:12.940
But switching genuine intel for genuine intel?

00:28:13.110 --> 00:28:14.140
This is a first.

00:28:15.200 --> 00:28:15.810
Perhaps

00:28:16.110 --> 00:28:17.330
it's because the version we recorded

00:28:17.350 --> 00:28:18.330
was more detailed.

00:28:18.590 --> 00:28:19.860
Perhaps he wanted to please you

00:28:20.160 --> 00:28:21.290
with it.

00:28:21.960 --> 00:28:22.490
Or perhaps

00:28:23.510 --> 00:28:24.770
he wanted you

00:28:24.790 --> 00:28:25.660
to receive

00:28:25.880 --> 00:28:27.050
